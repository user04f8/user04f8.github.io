"documents": [{"text": "From: aew@eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca (Alan Walford)\nSubject: Summary: ATI Graphics Ultra Questions etc\nReply-To: aew@eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca\nOrganization: Eos Systems Inc, Vancouver, B.C., Canada\nLines: 147\n\n\nTo those interested in the new ATI Ultra Cards:\n\nI had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and\nhad asked confirmation of some opinions.\n\nThis message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that\nreplied.\n\n\n> 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.\n\na) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB\n   and EISA version should have no problems.\n \nb) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't\n   work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way\n   of switching the \"memory aperture\" feature off to prevent this,\n   but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some \"help me\" messages\n   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this\n   problem.\n\nc) FALSE\n\nd) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M\n   by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.\n\n   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.\n\n\n> 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches\n>    set but it is much slower.\n\na) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM\n   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. \n \nb) Dunno.\n\nc) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus\n\n\n> 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.\n\na) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all\n   non-interlaced.\n\nb) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version\n   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.\n\nc) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.\n\n   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to \n   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color\n   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.\n\n\n> 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many\n>    cases.\n\na) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which\n   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due\n   to software incompatibility.\n\nb) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.\n\nc) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain\n   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they\n   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..\n   other accelerated cards also have bugs.\n\nd) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than\n   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my\n   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.\n\n   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond\n   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on\n   the old driver.\n\n\n> 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.\n\na) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.\n \nb) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what\n   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)\n   every 20 minutes or so...\n\nc) Depends on many many things.\n\n\n> 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)\n\na) I like it.\n\nb) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.\n\nc) Yes, this appears to be true :-)\n\nd) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are\n   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.\n   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer \n   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was \n   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)\n\n   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this\ngroup so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar\nwith the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don't have\nan Graphics Ultra yet.)\n\nATI Graphics Ultra Plus:\n- Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours\n- True colour(16.7M) at 800x600\n- Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)\n  Stretch full motion video windows to full size\n- Fast VGA\n- Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only)\n- Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think)\n- Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop\n- Around a 1/2 length card size\n- Priced from $400 U.S.\n\nATI Graphics Ultra Pro:\n- Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus\n- Faster performance with VRAMS\n- Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced\n- Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel\n- Priced from $600 U.S.\n\nATI Technologies\n(416) 756-0718\n\nI hope this summary can be of use to you.\n\nAl\n\nP.S.  I am not associated with ATI Technologies in any way other\n      than having used their previous ATI Ultra card for a few\n      years (which I generally liked).\n\n\n-- \nAlan Walford     Eos Systems Inc., Vancouver,B.C., Canada  Tel: 604-734-8655\naew@eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca           OR        ...uunet!wimsey.bc.ca!eosvcr!aew  \n"}, {"text": "From: mwalker@chama.eece.unm.edu (Mark Walker)\nSubject: Re: RFI: Art of clutchless shifting\nOrganization: University of New Mexico, Albuquerque\nLines: 14\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: warlock.eece.unm.edu\n\nIn article <93112.103631LRR105@psuvm.psu.edu>, <LRR105@psuvm.psu.edu> writes:\n>I HAVE, THEY SHOWED THE FOOT CAM AND TELEMETRY FOR RUSTY WALLACE SHIFTING AT AT\n>LANTA LAST YEAR AND HE NEVER TOUCHED THE CLUTCH EXCEPT VERY SLIGHTLY WHEN DOWN\n>SHIFTING - 700 HP IS PRETTY POWERFUL TO ME\n\nI doubt his trans uses standard syncros.

According\n-> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined \n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\n-> \n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\n\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\n\n\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\n\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\n\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\n\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\n\t character of a well-regulated militia, \n\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \n\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\n\n    \tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n\ta year.\n\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \n\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \n\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\n\n\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \n\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \n\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \n\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \n\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \n\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \n\tNational Guard.\n\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\n\n\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \n\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \n\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \n\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \n\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \n\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\n\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \n\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\n\n\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \n\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n\trecital of particulars.\"\n\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\n\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\n\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \n\t   this puzzle\"\n\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\n\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:\n\t   explain an error\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\nfor \"qualify\" is:\n\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\n\t   of; characterize.\n\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \n\t   task.\n\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\n\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\n\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\n\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \n\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \npeople's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\nme.\n\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\n\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?

I will do some\ntests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to\nmodify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.

The goalie\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\nfor his team.\n\nEposode Summary\n---------------\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\nhe bought from the concession stand.\n\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\nof me. Beauty.\"\n\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\n\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\nand the AHL championships.\n\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\nwent cold.\n\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\nbe a 'country club'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves... If\nthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the\nyardarm by their thumbs.\"\n\n\nRating\n------\nNothing too special in this episode.\n\nI'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS\nand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.\n\nThat said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display\non a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port\nwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say\nyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\ncombination.\n\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use\nof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different\nin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.\n\nThe reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12\nscreens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server\nthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,\nMAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,\nthis is 12.\n\nAs such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.\nX server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X\nI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is\nnot the case.\n\nWe just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of\ncourse, I could say \"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\"\n-- \n----\nRusty Sanders, Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or...\n         ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!\n"}, {"text": "From: eshneken@ux4.cso.uiuc.edu (Edward A Shnekendorf)\nSubject: Zionism\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 24\n\nThe following flyer was distributed at AIPAC's 34th annual Policy Conference:\n\nBecause when we're not in Israel, we're told to go back where we came from and\nwhen we come back to Israel we're told to go back to where we came from and \nwhen we're vocal we have too much influence and when we are quiet we can afford\nto be because we we control everything anyway and when we buy something we can\nafford to because Jews are so rich and when we don't buy something it's because\nwe're cheap and because when we are poor we're called dirty Jew and ignorant\nand when we're not we're called called rich Jew and JAP and when we are visibly\norganized it's because there is a secret Jewish conspiracy and when we're not it\nis because there is a secret Jewish conspiracy and because we're told we're not\na people and when we say we are we're still told that we're not and when we\nmarry our own people we're called racist and we don't we're contaminating \nsomeone else's \"race\" and because we're under fire from the Left and from the \nRight and because there are whites who hate us for not being white and because\nthere are non-whites who hate us for being white  and because anti-semitic \nincidents are rising every year but we're told that anti-semitism doesn't \nexist or that we're paranoid and because we're told to shut up about the \nHolocaust and yet Holocaust revisionism is risng every year and when we are\n\"obnoxious\" we're called JAPs and when we are \"nice\" we're told we don't act\nJewish and because anti-semitism is now world-wide and because our people is\nnot yet free and because we do not have to complete the work but neither are\nwe free to desist from it for these reasons and many many more we are part of\nthe Jewish National Liberation Movement: ZIONISM.\n"}, {"text": "From: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nSubject: The museum of 'BARBARISM'.\nReply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nDistribution: world\nLines: 215\n\nIn article <C5I7Ap.ELD@acsu.buffalo.edu> v999saum@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu (Varnavas A.

The people of \nTurkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never \nabandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally \nhopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the\nparties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole \nperpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July \n15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop \nMakarios.\n\nFollowing the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with \nthe aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right \ngiven by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently \nand conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For \nthose Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island \nsince 1571. \n\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\n'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\ndestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece.

Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\n24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities\ncommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which\nhas been converted into a museum.\n\nAN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY\nGREEK TERRORISTS\n\nThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\nbloodshed...\n\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\n\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\nduring the same terrible event.\n\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\nAyshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\nheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.\n\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\nbrutally murdered.\n\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\nunder the double-bed.\n\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\nwere all wounded.\n\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\n\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\nAyshe and her daughter.\n\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\n\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\ndetention. They then released me.\"\n\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\n\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\ndays.\n\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\nterrible sights.\n\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\nchild's bicycle lay in a corner.\n\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\n\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\nhead.\n\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\n\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\n\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\n\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\n\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\n\n\n Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus. \n Date : 1 January, 1964. \n\n IL GIARNO (Italy)\n \n THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.\n\n Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues.

However, I do tend to materialism and\ndon't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.\n\n>How then can an atheist judge value? \n\nAn atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according\nto a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an\nabsolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit,\nas in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express\njudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code\nrather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.\nMy moral code is not particular different from that of others around\nme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I\nobject to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of\nline with what my society holds.\n\nIf your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it\ndoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral\ncode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity\nprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of\nour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving\nconsiderable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God just\nmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a\ncommon understanding about many moral issues.

An\nabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a\nBible they happen to agree with, and say \"this is good\", even if the\nact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in\nthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as\n\"excluded from discussion\", such that they \"cannot participate\", and\ntheir opinions given \"no weight whatsoever\" is the lowest form or\nreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort\nof someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,\nwrong, and the Bible.\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.

The Greek, for example, could say, \"better a beggar in the land\nof the living than a king in the land of the dead.\" (Iliad, I think).\n\nThe question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\nan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam\nor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their\nsins, in the Christian sense.

Someones even made the statement that science is\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\n\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\n    observable phenomenon.\n\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \n\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\n\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \n\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\nmanner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone's face,\"\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\nmorality. \n\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\nevidence.\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one's\n    point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be\n    simple and dignified.\n\t\t\t\tDiogenes\n"}, {"text": "From: schietke@unitas.or.uni-bonn.de (Juergen Schietke)\nSubject: extension to damaged chars of big fonts\nOrganization: Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics, Bonn\nLines: 16\n\nSorry about the garbage code, the following is used of course:\n\nXSetForeground(Disp, PixGC, BackgroundColor);\nXFillRectangle(Disp, Pixs, PixGC, 0, 0, Scr_width, Scr_height);\nXSetForeground(Disp, PixGC, ForegroundColor);\nXDraw[Line|String|Rectangle](Disp, Pixs, PixGC, ...);\nXCopyArea(Disp, Pixs, Win, PixGC, 0, 0, Win_width, Win_height, 0, 0);\n\nJuergen Schietke\nResearch Insitute for Discrete Mathematics\nUniversity of Bonn\nNassestr. 2\n5300 Bonn 1\n\nTel: (+49) 0228 738786\nE-Mail: schietke@or.uni-bonn.de\n"}, {"text": "From: rmehta@paul.rutgers.edu (Rahul Mehta)\nSubject: Info on Books on BIOS, 286 etc.\nOrganization: Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J.\nLines: 18\n\n\n\nHi Everybody,\n\n      I am interested in the following topics.\n\n1)BIOS programming on 286 and 386.\n2)Memory management in 286 and 386.\n3)Developing Visual Basic Custom Controls.\n\n     I would like to have your valuable opinion on the books\nthat are best in the above topics.

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \n    for the planet Venus. \n\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \n\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \n\n        The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\n    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\n\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus' \n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\n\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \n    across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.\n\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes' \n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \n\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \n    probes maintained that distinction.\n\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\n\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\n    gas to perform the operation.  \n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\n\n        Venus by Balloon\n\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of \n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \n    the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\n\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\n\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \n\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \n\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \n    encounter.\n\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\n    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \n    comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \n\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\n\n        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \n    location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\n\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\n    successfully arrived. \n\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\n    permeated the planet's atmosphere. \n\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \n    had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\n\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\n    journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \n\n        Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \n    miles) above the surface. \n\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's \n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\n\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\n    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\n\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \n    over the last seven years.\n\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\n    bodies with one space vessel.\n\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \n    miles) towards the surface.\n\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \n    through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer \n    failed to function.\n\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\n    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \n    rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in \n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\n\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \n    hours.\n\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\n\n        Future Plans Diverted\n\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\n    the early 1990s.\n\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's \n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \n    the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to \n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\n\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\n    Mars' largest moon, Phobos. \n\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\n\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\n    landing in March of 1989. \n\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \n\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\n\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \n    make money.  \n\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\n\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \n\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\n\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \n    probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.\n\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\n    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\n    that violent atmosphere.\n\n        On the Drawing Boards\n\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\n\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\n    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\n\n        Humans on Venus      \n\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\n    Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \n    to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\n    if not millennia.\n\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\n\n        Bibliography -\n\n         Barsukov, V.

Whereas Sagan's\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\n\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\n\n\tThe postulated models have become accepted as the reality\n\tinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\n\tAuthoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\n\tanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism\n\tof the model approach to earth problems is warranted because\n\tmany key parameters have not been included.\n\nThis statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when\nconvincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results\nmay one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thought\nI'd clear that up before things really got out of hand. \n \n-- \nboundary\n\nno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he\nvenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina) \n"}, {"text": "From: phoenix.Princeton.EDU!carlosn (Carlos G.
