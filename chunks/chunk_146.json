Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Boeing TSTO (Was: Words from Chairman of Boeing)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 83\n\ngames@max.u.washington.edu  writes:\nRe; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...\n>\"As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have\n>a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some\n>of our customers about that.  As far as commercialization, that is\n>a long ways off.  ...\n> Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this\n>threaten further work on DC-? ?\n  \n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\npayload on an expendable second stage.\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\n  \n>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\nstudies trying straighten out the government's future space\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\nfor future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\n   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't\nthat there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\nthe near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a\nfinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor\n  \n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n"}, {"text": "From: luriem@alleg.edu The Liberalizer (Michael Lurie)\nSubject: Re: YANKKES 1 GAME CLOSER\nArticle-I.D.: alleg.1993Apr6.210350.2865\nOrganization: Allegheny College\nLines: 29\n\nIn article <002251w.5.734117130@axe.acadiau.ca> 002251w@axe.acadiau.ca  \n(JASON WALTER WORKS) writes:\n>     The N.Y.Yankees, are now one game closer to the A.L.East pennant.   \nThey \n> clobbered Cleveland, 9-1, on a fine pitching performance by Key, and two \n> homeruns by Tartabull(first M.L.baseball to go out this season), and a  \nthree \n> run homer by Nokes.

Organization of units of guerilla fighters.\"\n\nNow, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution:\n\n \"... If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained?\n By:\n\n      1. Propaganda \n      2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination\n      3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people\n      4. The arming of the people\n      5. Organization of revolutionary committees\n      6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with\n         the official bodies and journals\n      7. Organization of financial zones for public collection \n      8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government\n         officers, spies, traitors, grafters, and all sorts of oppressors\n      9.

My question is whether that\nstatement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.\n\nHate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed\nsince I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not \nsomething is a sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\nwhat happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the \nstronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so \nstrong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate\nthe sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and \ndo things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even \nbelieve what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins\nto hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their\nbehavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly\ncannot be a good way to build love.\n\nIn the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our \nneighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he \ncommands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians\nsupposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one\nway to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We\nneed to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love \nwith theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to\nlove someone is to pray for them. \n\n- Scott\n-- \nThis is my signature.

This will stay with that family for\none (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and\nother prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our Lady\nof Fatima.  The move will be like a simple procession of folks\npicking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing'\nprayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the\nprior notification about the move.

He works\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\nto make the team next year.\n\n#3\tDAVID WILLIAMS\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\nGrade:\t\tC/C-\n\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\n'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\nplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\n\n#4\tJAYSON MORE\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nAfter being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp\nbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\n\n#5\tNEIL WILKINSON\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB-\n\nWilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\n\n#6\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (A)\n\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\nbut he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\n\n#19\tDOUG ZMOLEK\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB\n\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have \nwith it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for\nothers who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just \nChristian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems\nwithin Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters\nof personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by\nobjective means.  \n\nChoosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal \nsovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these \nmatters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them \nbut are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this\nthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus \nanyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing\nthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the\nhonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.\nEven a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is\nuniversalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud\nnotion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that\nleads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)\n\n\n>Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n>\"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.\"\n>                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\ncomments, criticism welcome...\n-Ken\nalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\n\n[It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own\nability to know the truth.

A.D. 388\n\nThere are many others.\n\n>As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was\n>more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin\n>for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)\n\nNo.  We have, for instance:\n\n    Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of\n    Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, \"the Virgin\"?\n    ... And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman\n    remains undefiled.\n                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, \"Panacea against all heresies\",\n                   between A.D. 374-377.\n\n    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine\n    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen\n    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent\n    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal\n    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is\n    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.\n                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of \n                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392\n\nNote that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I\ndon't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quite\nsure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated\nlong before Augustine's time.  We hold that it originated with the \nApostles.\n\nStrictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independent\nof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately \nConceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin\nand not been Immaculately Conceived.\n\n>Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\n>a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\n>because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science\n>discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\n>Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\n\nNo.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original\nsin was transmitted at conception, when a person's life begins.\nBiology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the\ntruth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could have\nachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate\nConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,\nbut the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.\n\nThe celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was\ngiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept\nfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).\n\n>Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \n>refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \n>would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\n>to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nNo.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not\nbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do\nis enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,\nwhich ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.\n\nSecond, the \"case for the doctrine\" was irreformably sealed in 1854 \nwith the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull \"Ineffabilis Deus\" by\nPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as\na dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be\nbelieved by the faithful.\n\nThe apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most\nthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation\nof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never\nclaimed that, nor shall she.\n\nIn Christ's Peace,\n\nBrad Kaiser\n(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)\n\n\t  Those who trust in Him shall understand truth,\n\t  and the faithful shall abide with Him in love;\n\t  Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones,\n\t  and His care is with His elect.\n\t\t    -- Wis 3:9 [NAB]\n"}, {"text": "From: paladin@world.std.com (Thomas G Schlatter)\nSubject: Re: Hhy won't my DOS apps run in a window?!\nOrganization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA\nLines: 8\n\nIn article <735417915snz@sigma.demon.co.uk> jason@sigma.demon.co.uk writes:\n>Can somebody help me out there?

To assist cooling\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\nhot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\njust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\nrapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\nseen rising out of these towers.\n\nThat slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\nit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\nthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\n\nThe towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\nsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\nboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across\nthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and\nby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it\nback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference\n(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\"\nturbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine).\n\n                                        R.

I\nhave seen the film called \"The Gay Agenda\" and along with my church we found\nit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\nhomosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.\n\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\n\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\n\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\n\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\nthrough prayer.  \"I'd like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I'm\nno longer deserve it.\"\n  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There's no reality\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\nsexuality are men.\"\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\n  \"It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it's really impossible to\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is\nabout, I don't want to be this way anymore.\"\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\nfor hell.\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\nwhere the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\nadding, \"They'll do anything to reach these people.\"\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\n  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\nRaphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\nthat I should be a 'reformed' gay person.\"\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally's\nshow,\" \"I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\n  \"I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We'd go to conferences in other cities,\nand we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\nelse.\"\n  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\n  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\nchurch and closed the ministry's doors.  \"I'd convinced myself that there\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I'm interest-\ned in belief systems that aren't judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\nmay have brought to our community.\"\n\n---end article---\n\nCaligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\nof former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\nthem, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\nMaury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\nself-acceptance.\n\nThank you.\n"}, {"text": "From: m88max@tdb.uu.se (Max Brante)\nSubject: VGA on atari monoitor ??\nOrganization: Dept. of Scientific Computing, Uppsala Univ.\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nLines: 11\n\nIs it possible to connect a atari monochrome monitor to some kind of VGA card?\n\nIf someone have done this please let me know how.\n\n\tThanx\n\n      __   __         _  _               \n     l  \\ /  l  ___  ( \\/ )          Max Brante   m88max@tdb.uu.se\n     l l l l l / _ \\  \\  /         \n     l l\\_/l l( (_) l /  \\\tInstitutionen f|r teknisk databehandling\n     l_l   l_l \\__l_l(_/\\_)               Uppsala Universitet  \n"}, {"text": "From: colling@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com (Michael Collingridge)\nSubject: Re: Hockey guest spots...\nOrganization: Schlumberger CAD/CAM; Ann Arbor, Michigan (USA)\nSummary: Tod Hartje on Letterman\nLines: 33\n\nIn article 27867 of rec.sport.hockey sclark@epas.utoronto.ca \n(Susan Clark) asks:\n>Hi guys....\n>        I'm looking to answe a bit of trivia.

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \nstandards.\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, \nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is \nalso offering this card in the \"TurboBahn\" combination packaged \nwith their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.\n        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, \nWINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \nvalue.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to \"turbocharge\" \nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \nchip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \nreliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D \nStudio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.

I know of\nIris, Indigo, and Crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line?\n(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.

My brother got stung by a bee. I know\nhe is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized\nswelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that,\nhowever, because that's not written in their little rule book.\n\nI would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad\nreactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting. Not that\nthe stuff is BAD or POISON and needs to be banned, but people need to be aware\nthat it can have a bad effect on SOME people.\n\nLone Wolf\n\n                                      Happy are they who dream dreams,\nEd Philips                            And pay the price to see them come true.\nslyx0@cc.usu.edu                                              \n                                                              -unknown\n \n"}]}
