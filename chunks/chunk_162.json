Dave\nWinfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of\nFame.  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players\nof all time.  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career\nof any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage.\n\nOn the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best 750 players\nof all time.\n\nAnd Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise.\n\n>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\n>giving\n>Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\n>marginal.\n\n>Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both\n>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.\n\nWe're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here.  There probably\naren't 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two.\n\n>     Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors\n>so\n>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if\n>something\n>isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When\n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential\n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent.\n\nGarvey sucked.  Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't\nbelong near Cooperstown.\n\n Gee, can these guys even compare to\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\n\nIf Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be \nmarginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for\na while longer)\n\nTo put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights\nvalues of the careers of the players you mention.  In parenthesis\nis how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it.\nWhile no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give\nyou a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.\n\nRobin Yount 43.0 (41)\nOzzie Smith 42.1 (45)\nDave Winfield 40.3 (53)\nEddie Murray 37.5 (68)\nDarrel Evans 35.2 (80)\nKirby Puckett 24.3 (180)\nNolan Ryan 21.6 (219)\nJack Morris 11.8 (478)\nDave Kingman 0.4 \nSteve Garvey -5.8\n\nTo give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall:\nOf the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0, 64 are in the Hall\nof Fame. The ones who aren't include 4 19th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby\nGrich, and Bob Johnson.\n\nOf those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9, 15 of 25 are in.  Of\nthose eligible who score between 25.0 and 29.9, 24 of 44 are in.\n\n \nGreg \n"}, {"text": "Nntp-Posting-Host: surt.ifi.uio.no\nFrom: Thomas Parsli <thomasp@ifi.uio.no>\nSubject: Re: Change of name ??\nIn-Reply-To: popovich@cs.columbia.edu (Steve Popovich)'s message of Wed, 21\n        Apr 1993 01:54:51 GMT\nOrganization: Dept. of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway\n        <93864@hydra.gatech.EDU>\n        <POPOVICH.93Apr20205451@prince.cs.columbia.edu>\nLines: 37\nOriginator: thomasp@surt.ifi.uio.no\n\n\nHow we survived ww2:\nWe mailed postings about things we didn't know any thing about\nto ONLY the wrong places.\n\nI'm NOT trying to censor this or any newsgroup, I'm just trying to\ngive some hints about OTHER newsgroups.\nDoesn't this belong to alt.conspiracy ??\n\nNOTE!!!\nMy posting was in reply to those about FBI torching the plasce after\nfilling it with napalm, and arrested people dissapering.\n\n>We all know what a quisling is, right?\nObviously we don't.....\nVidkun Quisling is known to be a traitor in Norway, not a 'censor'.\nIf I have betrayed my country (Norway) bescause I implied that som of \nyou jumped to conclusions/sound a little paranoid then I think there\nis a LOT of quislings in Norway.......\n\n\nAbout Waco\nIt looks to me as the BATF and FBI can't handle situations like this.\nThe way it went reminds me of 'stun' bomb beeing dropped on a house\nin LA from a helicopter.

After \nthe game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to \ncompete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East \nCoast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor \nleague clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n**\n  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that \nthe Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the \nMinnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning \ngeneral manager Phil Esposito.

Matchups will be based on overall points with the \nfour division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds \nin each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff \nrounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except \nmatchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-\n2 to reduce travel.

A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \nnew teams.\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \n1994.\n\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \n1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a \ndelay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.\n\n-----\n \n- League news:\n\nDisputes:\n\n  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary \narbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\n \n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in \nand around Montreal.

There are five major scoring zones: \n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \nright, and (5) five-hole.\n \n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven \nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\n\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \nlost the game, 6-4.\n\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\n\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992.

So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing \nby this \"hated\" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?\nElisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.\nA book that you should be familiar with and not \"hate\". \"Candida species \ncolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly \nthereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \nit.\n\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: \"However, some factors, such as \nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \n\n\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

(shudder)\n> Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying?\n\nMy, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you \nnoticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point \nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of \nGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.\n\nYou know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small \nlittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in \nSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.\nI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what \nI've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into \n\"The Yeast Connection\" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain \nand simple.

Apologies to those who've\nseen the following before:]\n\nTo explain my position on the \"War On Drugs,\" I offer this:\n\nDrugs And Crime: A New Approach\n\nby Ken Barnes\n\n\nGiven that:\n\n1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for \nmuch of the crime which afflicts our nation.\n\n2. People who want drugs (particularly people who \nare predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get \nthem, whether or not they are legally available.\n\n3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs \nare readily available to those who want them.\n\n4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is \nresponsible for a significant drain on the productive \nresources of our country, and this occurs in a variety \nof ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are \nunable to learn, to the spread of disease among \naddicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse \nand tobacco smoking.\n\n5. A general economic principle of government is \nthat whatever is subsidized you get more of, and \nwhatever is taxed you get less of.  To be most \neffective in confronting the nation's drug problem, \nsome way must be found to utilize these additional \npowers of government to make drug dealing and drug use \nless attractive.\n\nWhile this country's current efforts to combat \nlegal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is \na greater awareness of the health consequences of \nsmoking, and designated-driver programs have helped \nreduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be \nsaid for the \"war\" on illegal drugs.  There remains a \ncore group of illegal drug users which support \ninternational networks of smugglers, pushers, growers, \nprocessors, kingpins, and gangsters.  These networks \nand their \"marketing activities,\" which include drive-\nby shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities, \nand smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly \nresponsible for a large proportion of the crimes \ncommitted in our country every day.\n\nClearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are \nlinked.  It takes only a moment's reflection to \nrecognize how they are linked.  The link is money.  As \nwith this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol \nconsumption, a black market has been created, in which \ngreedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a \nbygone era, have profited enormously from their \nillegal trade.  The victims of this trade include not \nonly the innocent people unfortunate enough to be \ncaught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug \nusers themselves.\n\nWere it not for the black market, and the violent \nmonopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be \nthe thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they \nhave become in order to pay the high prices the drug \nlords demand.  In the absence of the drug lords, most  \nwould be, I believe, simply people with a problem, \neither a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a \ncriminal problem.\n\nLet me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that \nwe let the criminals who have been preying on our \nsociety for these many years of Prohibition off the \nhook.  On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is \none which would not result in either the government or \nprivate industry getting into the business of \npromoting crack cocaine, or any other presently \nillegal drug for that matter.  Neither is it an \napproach which sees law abiding citizens handing over \nmore and more of their freedom and privacy in an \neffort to track down illegal drug users, until \"the \nland of the free and the home of the brave\" looks like \na police state.\n\nHere then is my proposal:\n\n1. Possession and use of all presently illegal \ndrugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them \nremains illegal.  'Potheads' can grow their own \nmarijuana (as many already do today), other drug users \ncan legally import their poison of choice as long as \nthey pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug \nexperimenters develops.\n\n2. Because of the barter economy which supplies \nthe drug users, the black market profits that have so \nenriched the drug lords dwindle.  If these drugs can \nbe obtained for 'free' or next to nothing, why buy \nthem?  Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek \nto sell these \"noncommercial\" drugs even at relatively \nlow prices.  Therefore,\n\n3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on \nthose individuals who continue to buy and sell, and \nalso on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to \nafford even low prices.  But here is where the \nstrategy begins to differentiate between the drug \ndealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their \nvictims.\n\n4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are \npermitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a \ndrug test.  Those who choose to cooperate are informed \nthat upon conviction for the crime they are accused \nof, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be \ninstitutionalized until they are clean, and only then \nwill they begin to serve their sentence.  If they \nchoose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they \ncan begin to serve their sentence right away.  Those \nwho choose not to undergo the drug test and are \nconvicted face stiffer fines and serve longer \nsentences.\n\n5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals \nserves several purposes:\n\nDrug using criminals (and this includes drunk \nand/or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their \nsources of supply, thus reducing the total number of \ndrug users in society at large, and consequently \ndecreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting \nmore of the remaining drug dealers out of business.\n\nInstitutionalization provides an incentive for \ndrug using criminals to straighten themselves out, \nbefore becoming part of the general prison population.\n\nWhile helping protect society from crime, \ninstitutionalization could also serve to deter drug \nusers from becoming criminals, since drug using \ncriminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed \nprior to serving their sentences by the additional \ntime it takes for them to sober up.\n\nInstitutionalization of drug using criminals \nseparate from the general prison population would also \nprovide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could \nvolunteer for research studies of new techniques and \ntreatments for addictive disease, with the potential \nto benefit both themselves and others.\n\n6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not \ndrug users themselves, and this is particularly true \nof the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit \norganizations.  Under this proposal, dealers would be \nmore readily identifiable, since upon arrest they \nwould presumably pass the drug test, or else decline \nto take it in order to avoid having to explain why \nthey are in possession of drugs when it is apparent \nthey do not use them.  Declining to take the test, \nthey would of course face stiffer penalties.  While \neach case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug \nwould have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of \na suspect's drug test could provide additional \nevidence for the prosecution.\n\n7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to \nthe decline of smoking in our country by making \ncigarettes more costly while at the same time \nproviding revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, \nnoncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money \ngenerated should be used to combat their use.  \nEnforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis \nhowever, and should not be used as an excuse to \ninfringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial \ndrug users, since to do so would have the effect of \nreintroducing Prohibition.\n\nInstead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the \ntax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever \nfound in their possession during the course of routine \npolice operations, they will be required to pay the \ntax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to \nbe destroyed.  If drug dealers are found to be selling \nnoncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, \nthey will face additional prosecution for evading the \ntax.  The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug \ndealing charges is already in use in some \njurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently \nlimited by the illegality of drug possession.\n\nRevenue from drug possession taxes and import \ntariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising \ncampaigns, and provide support to private sector drug \ntreatment programs for those unable to afford \ntreatment.\n\n8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must \nbe ended.  Federal support of tobacco farming is both \nimmoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and \nthe marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands \nin many states must likewise be eliminated.\n\nWhile my proposal would have the effect of \npermitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it \nwould hold the users of all drugs responsible for \ntheir actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm \ndrugs have on our society, particularly the crime \ncaused by the illegal drug trade.  So long as we \nremain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, \nand freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always \nhave a drug problem.  Whether it takes the form of \nheroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk \ndrivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or \nemphysema patients struggling for breath after a \nlifetime of smoking, the results are the same: \nneedless suffering and death.  As a society we must \nrecognize that while our society permits us to harm \nourselves with drugs, as we are already doing \n(regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand \nagainst the harm that drugs and drug users cause to \nothers.  We must particularly oppose the vicious and \nviolent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug \nusers.  By taking the profits out of their deadly \ntrade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting \ndown these powerful criminal organizations.\n\nThe question of whether drug use is a moral or \nmedical problem depends on which group of drug users \nyou're talking about.  Different drugs have different \neffects, and some are more addictive than others.  The \naddictiveness of a drug also often varies between \nindividuals, and so we have some people who can drink \nalcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot \nresist the bottle.  Nicotine, which former Surgeon \nGeneral C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as \nheroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects, \nand while some people can stop smoking by willpower \nalone, others continue to smoke even after treatment \nfor lung cancer.\n\nFor those individuals who can stop taking drugs \non their own, we may argue that because they have \nchosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on \ntheir part, or an unwillingness to face the \ndifficulties of life.  But for the addicts, while they \nmay have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the \ntime they discover their addiction it is too late.  We \ncannot hold them responsible for their disease, any \nmore than we would blame someone who is drowning for \nan inability to swim.  Perhaps they should have known \nnot to go near the water, or perhaps someone should \nhave warned them of the danger, but in their present \ncircumstances warnings will not help.  Neither does it \nhelp for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing \nthem weights. \n\n\n--Standard disclaimer-- \n*.x,*dna**************************************************************\n*(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg.      * Conservative libertarians     *\n* \\'  KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu    *      for Pro-Balance!         *\n*(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com**********************\n\"I find television very educating.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n- - ---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.\n"}, {"text": "From: Mark@tdkt.kksys.com (MARK STEIGER)\nSubject: Minnesota Shame?\nLines: 30\n\nSH>I'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I can\n  >here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).

The church, for example,\nforbids that anyone \"produce, describe or use any substance containing...\natoms\". \n\nPHILIP K. DICK\n\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n\"A Maze of Death\"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n\"VALIS\"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n\"The Bible\"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener.

Contains an outstanding\nappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious\narea.

Includes great refutations of the most\nchallenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting\ncontempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.\n541 pages.

Examines the way in which\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \n316 pages.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\nGod\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

On what\ndo you base this?  \n\n       And given that smuggling channels are already established,\nand given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly\nmore expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering\ndoing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than\ndrugs?\n\n>       All production\n>\twould have to be local. \n\n       Now *that* was a jump.  In any case, define \"local.\"  It's\na big country.\n \n>       There are not all that many people\n>\twho have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile\n>\tfirearms from scratch. High-ranking crime figures could\n>\tobtain imported Uzis and such, but the average person, and\n>\taverage thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would\n>\tpay through the nose for it. \n\n       Wow, you gotta love the speculation.\n\n       As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw\nores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and\nout of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even\nhave the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.  \n\n       I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be\nworth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed\nto get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of\nevery ship which came through.\n\n       It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how\nmuch *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood\nof being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.
