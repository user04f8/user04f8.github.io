Does He grade on\na curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\nwouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the\nlove and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we\nare all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But\nthe Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only\nthe best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love.\nIt's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it\nand who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the\nother place. But it is really much more than that...\nThere are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the\nlight and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us.\n"}, {"text": "From: madhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann)\nSubject: Re: Amusing atheists and agnostics\nOrganization: Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things\nLines: 26\n\ntimmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu (\"Half\" Bake Timmons) writes: >\nMaddi: >>\n\n>>Whirr click whirr...Frank O'Dwyer might also be contained\n>>in that shell...pop stack to determine...whirr...click..whirr\n>\n>>\"Killfile\" Keith Allen Schneider = Frank \"Closet Theist\" O'Dwyer = ...\n\n>= Maddi \"The Mad Sound-O-Geek\" Hausmann\n\nNo, no, no!

Theory of one-way hash functions, distinctions of\n terms. MD4 and MD5. Snefru.\nX-Last-Updated: 1993/04/16\n\nArchive-name: cryptography-faq/part07\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 7: Digital Signatures and Hash Functions\n\nThis is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is a one-way hash function?\n* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\n* What are MD4 and MD5?\n* What is Snefru?\n\n\n* What is a one-way hash function?\n\n  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and\n  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally\n  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't\n  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not\n  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also\n  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the\n  same hash.\n\n  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an\n  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash\n  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are\n  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user\n  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,\n  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the\n  signature can do the same thing.\n\n  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.\n\n* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\n\n  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a\n  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which\n  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it\n  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption\n  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have\n  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1\n  if and only if X = H(M).\n\n  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private\n  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the\n  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.\n  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public\n  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,\n  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.\n\n  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to\n  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real\n  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key\n  isn't published, so it's private.

The federal government has an interest in\nthe intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of\ncivil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a\nlot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically.\nIt is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid\nsince over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was\ngetting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being\npart of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south\nstick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally\nthey wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were\nexpeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try\nit anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under\nthe law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent\nas much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to\nsomebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did\nthe school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the\npresident can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the\nmilitia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the\nthousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey\nor face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god,\nthey did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And\nthe governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls\nthat had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need\nsuch an ability in federal jurisdiction.\n-RSW\n\n-- \n* Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  *\n* 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   *\n* Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   *\n* Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *\n"}, {"text": "From: feustel@netcom.com (David Feustel)\nSubject: Re: WACO: Clinton press conference, part 1\nOrganization: DAFCO: OS/2 Software Support & Consulting\nLines: 10\n\nI predict that the outcome of the study of what went wrong with the\nFederal Assault in Waco will result in future assaults of that type\nbeing conducted as full-scale military operations with explicit\nshoot-to-kill directives.\n-- \nDave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>\n\nI'm beginning to look forward to reaching the %100 allocation of taxes\nto pay for the interest on the national debt.

The church is to last for all time.\nHowever, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This\nis evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the\n\"super-apostles\" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions\nhow people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2\nThessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will\nabandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will\nsearch for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4).\nSuch passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them\n(Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse\n14:  \"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world\nas a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\"  Even today,\nthere are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar\nwith:  the non-need of baptism and the \"praying of Jesus into your life\nfor salvation\".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been\ntaken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just\nplain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and\nLuke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The\nchurch Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.

There are times I simply forget a lesson.\nI, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me\nthis help.  And I took him up on his offer.

Stereo sound became \n standard with the SE/30.\n\nIBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system \ninteracts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing \nBIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation\nof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program \ninteraction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer \nJawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \nMac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \n the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a \n 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock\n (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals\n from EGA/CGA etc. \nMCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*\n subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA \n and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  \n Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.\nSVGA:  Super VGA*\n This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch \n all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer \n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: \n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \n 64K \"window\", etc.\nOther non-SVGA standards: \n8514/a:\n IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \n not have interlacing. \nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \n are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at \n 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.\nXGA-2\n Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in\n Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area\n fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-\n exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be \n far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth \n isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other \n companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh \n rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual \n discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.\n*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.\n\nExpansion\nBoth Mac & IBM\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  \n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\n drivers.  \"Fast SCSI-1\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\n\nMac\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \n size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting \n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  \n Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: \n 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \n through put down.\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet \n to DMA.\nNuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:\n ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\" instead of the \n old 12\".\nQuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's \n VLBus - \"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\" (Byte 10/92:128).\n Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\n\nIBM\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\n\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\n only used with smaller [\u00b2 60mb] hard drives.\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. \nESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface\n ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in\n many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of\n hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. \n\nBUS interfaces\n{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working \nwith old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}\nISA\n 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a\n 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).\n 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,\n hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards\n aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}\n while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's\n showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit\n (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  \nMCA {Micro Channel}\n IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\" \n (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components \n involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA \n and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).\nEISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}\n 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to \n self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable \n interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.\nVESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}\n Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}\n 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus \n mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for \n video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of\n their patents (Mel Martinez).\nQuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture\n (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines\n (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.\nPCI\n Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace \n ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.\n\nOSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]\nand multiple application use.}\nMac\n512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows \nApple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, \nmenu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require \nclone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires \naccess to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM \nchips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support \ninterface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS \nhas the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and \ntherefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control \nover hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with \nsome of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a \ntotally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon \nWtte).\n6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, \n cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  \n Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program \n interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of \n AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a \n 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as \n real RAM is below 8MB.\n6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.\n6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.\n7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard \n to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present \n non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on\n system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking \n within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing \n can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be \n accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, \n Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable \n IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType \n support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present \n machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is \n both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit \n mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last \n 'free' OS.\n7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than \n 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode \n on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. \n Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades\n {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.\n [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system \n fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any \n RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all \n fonts from the system file.]\nA/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and \n a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS \n is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac \n ROMs.  Price: $709.\nNote: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats \nincluding the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and \nDCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' \nand AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most \nstill play.\n\nIBM\n Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for \nprogrammers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  \nSince hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, \nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \nis harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it \nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \nsupport is needed.\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\"Undocumented Windows\") and \n\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \n#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC \njudicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no \naction.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of \nchoosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has \nturned down Microsoft's copyright of \"Windows\" which would allow it to charge \na fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).\nMicroSoft OSes\nDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier \n with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program \n must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS \n Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit \n Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in\n DOS 4.0.\nDOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk \n defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for \n networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} \n (Byte April 1993:44-46).\nDOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).\nWindow 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to \n deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to\n run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the\n equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].\n This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac\n programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and\n still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed\n is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).\n Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS\n counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).\nWindow 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base \n requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. \n Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).\nWindows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  \n Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 \n with built-in peer to peer networking support.\nWindows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the \n swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in \n the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the \n reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM \n but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).\n This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric \n multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in\n networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even\n though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor\n is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993\n (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993\n (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495\n (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).\nOther OSes\nPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS \n 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).\nDR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} \n and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later \n version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple \n file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).\nOS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,\n 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, \n multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file \n to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. \n IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this \n (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).\nAIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.\nNeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.

Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or \ntaking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are \nhandled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal \nrepresentation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment \nof 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and \nthe FPU programmed directly.\n\nIBM\n Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when \nemulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever \ncompiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers \nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\n\nNetworking [Includes printing]\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\nMac\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \nnetwork option since 1989.\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\n\nIBM  \nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more \ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \nfinder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  \nInfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)\nPrinting {Very OS dependent}\nDOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, \n and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written \n software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \n software program to the next.\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \"jobs\" \n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \"active\"... even if they \n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \n on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine \n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \n and intelligent about this.\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \nnot have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and \nnot that of the OS involved.\n\nPrice issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features \nthan IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars \nby both worlds.\nThe IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware \nstandarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to \nhandle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac \nhardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  \nbuilt-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and \nNuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent \nequipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs \nwhich cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.\n Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.\nAll Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.
