True,\nCone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,\nthese teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with\nlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas\nJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.\n     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb\npitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a\nchance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no\npitching.  At least, to me.\n     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team\nwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real\norder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but\nwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)\nOr a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,\nMays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.\n     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by\nseasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in\ntheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all\nthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all\nthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.\n     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-\ntime teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results\nI would love to see that.\n-- \nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a great\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\n"}, {"text": "From: dbc@welkin.gsfc.nasa.gov (David Considine)\nSubject: Re: Is MSG sensitivity superstition?\nOrganization: Code 916, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nLines: 19\n\nIn article <1993Apr15.180459.17852@nmr-z.mgh.harvard.edu> milsh@nmr-z.mgh.harvard.edu (Alex Milshteyn) writes:\n>This was known long ago.

Not!\nOrganization: Oklahoma State University, Computer Science, Stillwater\nKeywords: drugs DEA WOD legalization\nLines: 140\n\nThe DEA and other organizations would have the American people\nbelieve that we are winning the \"war on drugs\".  I'm going to\ndispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing\nyou the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions\nI've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly\ndemonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the\nrise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug\nabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality\nis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,\nsubstance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a\npossible solution to this problem.\n\nThe following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music\nand pot entitled \"Hello Again, Mary Jane\" which appears in the\ncurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).\n\n    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing\n    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \"Perhaps\n    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby\n    is out in full force,\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug\n    Enforcement Administration.  \"The fact is, they're losing the\n    battle.\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said\n    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner\n    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that\n    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of\n    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.\n\nThe chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\" by Mike\nSnider, p. 6D).\n\n    Adolescents' choices\n\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\n\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\n    1993 report\n\nWe are not winning the \"war on drugs\".  I think you can see that one\nof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that\nthe \"war on drugs\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---\nonly statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone\ndown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is\nan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to\ndeceive the public.\n\nUsage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same\ntime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).\nAlso, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down\nbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,\nif one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*\nthe statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \"war on drugs\" is\nbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs\ngo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,\nthen the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed\nin its true perspective.\n\nFor those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try\ndrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me\nthat it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*\ndrugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless\nattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to\nanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.\n\nThe solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to\nlegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be\nwithin reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few\ntimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.\nThe reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is\nbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the\ngovernment's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug\ninterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug\neducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because\nthe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often\ngoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that\naddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their\nmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;\nlegalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall\nsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.\n\nIMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been\ndone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to\nemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating\nthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than\nthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought\nabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can\nlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in\norder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods\nbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried\nout.  They are as follows:\n\n    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which\n      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this\n      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.\n      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used\n      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.\n\n    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of\n      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs\n      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from\n      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law\n      enforcement.\n\n    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of\n      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the\n      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.\n      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning\n      information should also be a felony.\n\n    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the\n      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This\n      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad\n      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.\n\nI'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have\nbeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought\nit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)\nall at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on\nWOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it\nthat you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,\nI posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my\nassertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---\nsomething which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot\n\nBefore:  \"David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets\n          the Bible through the barrel of a gun...\"  --ATF spokesman\nAfter:   \"[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets\n          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun...\"  --Me\n\n"}, {"text": "From: jburrill@boi.hp.com (Jim Burrill)\nSubject: Question about Islamic view   \nOrganization: Idaho River Country, The Salmon, Payette, Clearwater, Boise, Selway, Priest.\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1.8 PL6]\nLines: 8\n\nA question regarding the Islamic view towards homosexuality came up in a\ndiscussion group that I participate in, and I'd like to ask the question here,\n\n\"What is the Islamic view towards homosexuality?\"             \n\nJim Burrill\njburrill@boi.hp.com\n\n"}, {"text": "From: haston@utkvx.utk.edu (Haston, Donald Wayne)\nSubject: Church related graphics\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \nKeywords: Christian graphics\nOrganization: University of Tennessee Computing Center\nLines: 13\n\nI am looking for some good quality graphics files which are\nsuitable for use in church-related presentations.

If\n\tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't\n\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\n\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\n\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\n\n\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\n\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\n\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\n\twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections\n\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,\n\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\n\n\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\n\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\n\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\n\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\n\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\n\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\n\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\n\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\n\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\n\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\n\trules.\n\n\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\n\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\n\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\n\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\n\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've\n\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or\n\t``CEC''.\n\n\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\n\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\n\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\n\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\n\tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\n\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\n\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the\n\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged\n\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\n\tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\n\tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the\n\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for\n\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\n\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\n\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\n\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\n\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\n\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\n\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\n\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\n\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\n\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\n\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\n\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\n\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\n\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\n\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\n\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\n\n\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\n\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\n\tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't\n\toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\n\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\n\tequivalent NEC publications.\n\n\tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\n\tthe province.\n\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\n\n\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\n\tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical\n\tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's\n\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\n\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\n\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\n\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\n\twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\n\tfind one willing to supervise.\n\n\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\n\n\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\n\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,\n\tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make\n\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\n\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\n\tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that\n\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,\n\tand will impress the inspector.\n\n\tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to\n\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\n\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.\n\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\n\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\n\n\tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.\n\n\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip\n\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\n\twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it\n\ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of\n\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\n\n\tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C\n\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\n\tbecome very brittle.\n\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\n\n\tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\n\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're \n\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\n\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\n\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\n\n\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\n\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or\n\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\n\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\n\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\n\tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even\n\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\n\n\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\n\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\n\twork well).\n\t\n\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\n\tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\n\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\n\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\n\tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should\n\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\n\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\n\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't\n\tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.\n\n\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\n\tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.\n\n\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\n\n\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\n\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire\n\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\n\taccurate.\n\n\tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\n\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\n\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\n\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\n\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip\n\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to\n\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\n\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\n\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\n\tthat you'll gouge the conductors.\n\n\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well\n\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\n\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\n\tor the insulation.\n\n\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\n\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\n\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\n\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\n\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\n\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\n\n\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\n\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\n\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\n\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known\n\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\n\n\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\n\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\n\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\n\n\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\n\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\n\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \n\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\n\tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\n\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\n\tthat has no cover plate).\n\nSubject: What is UL listing?\n\n\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\n\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\n\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\n\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\n\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\n\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily\n\tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just\n\tthat it probably won't kill you.\n\n\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\n\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\n\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\n\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\n\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\n\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\n\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\n\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\n\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\n\toccupancy permits issued.\n\t\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\n\n\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\n\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\n\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\n\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\n\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\n\trequired by law.\n\n\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\n\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\n\tclaim.\n\n\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\n\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\n\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\n\tcompanies.\n\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\n\n\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\n\n\t    Residential Wiring\n\t    by Jeff Markell,\n\t    Craftsman Books,\n\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\n\n\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\n\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\n\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\n\t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\n\t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\n\t    Wiring Simplified\n\t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\n\t    Park Publishing Co.\n\t\n\tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\n\trevision.  Which is currently 1990.\n\n\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\n\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\n\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\n\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\n\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get\n\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\n\tquestions on the net ;-).\n\n\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\n\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\n\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\n\n\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\n\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\n\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\n\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\n\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\n\tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose\n\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\n\n\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\n\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\n\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\n\tthis.\n\n\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\n\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\n\tclaims.\n\n\tIn general, the process goes like this:\n\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\n\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\n\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\n\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not\n\t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose\n\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\n\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\n\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\n\t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to\n\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\n\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\n\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\n\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\n\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\n\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\n\t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\n\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\n\t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".\n\nSubject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.\n\tDo I have to upgrade?\n\n\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\n\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\n\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\n\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you\n\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\n\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\n\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\n\n\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\n\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\n\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\n\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\n\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\n\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\n\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\n\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not\n\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\n\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\n\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\n\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\n\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\n\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\n\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\n\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\n\n\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\n\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\n\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\n\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\n\tlow.\n\n\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\n\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\n\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\n\tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.\n\n\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\n\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\n\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\n\n\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\n\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\n\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\n\n \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\n \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\n \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\n\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\n\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\n\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\n\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\n\tnormally carries no current.\n\n\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\n\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\n\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\n\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\n\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\n\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\n\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\n\n\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\n\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\n\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\n\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\n\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\n\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\n\n\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\n\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\n\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\n\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \n\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\n\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\n\tinspector.\n\n\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\n\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\n\twell.\n\n\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\n\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\n\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\n\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\n\n\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\n\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\n\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\n\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\n\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\n\tservice).\n\nSubject: What is a circuit?\n\n\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\n\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\n\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\n\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\n\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\n\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\n\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\n\n\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\n\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\n\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\n\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\n\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\n\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\n\tair conditioners.\n\n\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\n\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\n\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\n\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\n\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\n\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\n\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\n\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\n\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\n\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\n\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\n\tpermissible.]\n\n\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\n\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\n\n\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\n\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\n\n\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\n\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\n\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\n\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\n\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\n\n\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\n\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\n\n\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\n\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\n\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\n\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\n\talternative to GFCI protection.\n\nSubject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\n\n\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\n\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\n\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\n\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\n\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\n\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\n\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\n\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\n\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\n\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\n\ttogether in the panel.\n\n\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\n\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\n\n\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\n\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\n\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\n\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\n\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\n\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\n\n\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\n\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\n\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\n\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\n\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\n\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\n\tequipment itself won't cause a fire.\n\n\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\n\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\n\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\n\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\n\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\n\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\n\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\n\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\n\treplaced.\n\n\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\n\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\n\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\n\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\n\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\n\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\n\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\n\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\n\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\n\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\n\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\n\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\n\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\n\tpurpose.\n\n\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\n\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\n\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\n\tcan often cause severe damage.\n\nSubject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?\n\n\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\n\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\n\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\n\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\n\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\n\tpenny\" trick.\n\n\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\n\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\n\n\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\n\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\n\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\n\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\n\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\n\tBreakers don't do this.\n\n\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\n\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\n\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\n\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\n\n\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\n\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\n\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\n\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\n\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\n\tif you need one.\n\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\n\n\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\n\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\n\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\n\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\n\t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.\n\n\tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\n\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\n\tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate\n\theat easily:\n\n\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\n\t\t14\t\t15\n\t\t12\t\t20\n\t\t10\t\t30\n\t\t8\t\t40\n\t\t6\t\t65\n\t\n\tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\n\ton the application and precise wire type.\n\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\n\n\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\n\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\n\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\n\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\n\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\n\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\n\truns.\n\n\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\n\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\n\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\n\tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits\n\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\n\twire.\n\nSubject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\n\n\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\n\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\n\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\n\tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\n\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\n\n\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\n\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\n\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\n\n\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\n\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\n\nSubject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\n\tused?\n\n\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used\n\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\n\tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\n\n\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\n\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\n\n\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the\n\twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically\n\tsecure.\n\n\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\n\tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the\n\tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.\n\n\tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\n\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\n\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\n\tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\n\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\n\n\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\n\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\n\ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because\n\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\n\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\n\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\n\n\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures\n\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\n\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\n\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\n\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\n\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\n\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\n\tthe circuit.\n\n\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\n\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\n\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\n\twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\n\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\n\tGFCI happy.\n\n\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\n\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\n\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\n\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\n\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\n\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\n\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\n\n\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\n\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,\n\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\n\tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water\n\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\n\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',\n\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\n\tlaundry appliances.\n\n\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\n\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\n\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\n\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to\n\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\n\n\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\n\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\n\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\n\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\n\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\n\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\n\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\n\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\n\nSubject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?\n\n\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a\n\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\n\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\n\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\n\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\n\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\n\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\n\tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no\n\tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring\n\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\n\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\n\n\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\n\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\n\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\n\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\n\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\n\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\n\tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\n\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a\n\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\n\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\n\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\n\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\n\n\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\n\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\n\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.\n\n\tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one\n\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't\n\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\n\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\n\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\n\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\n\n\tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little\n\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\n\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\n\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\n\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\n\nSubject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\n\n\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,\n\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without\n\ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against\n\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\n\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an\n\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\n\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\n\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\n\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\n\tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of\n\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\n\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\n\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\n\n\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\n\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\n\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\n\telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will\n\thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;\n\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\n\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to\n\tground...\n\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\n\n\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\n\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\n\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\n\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\n\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\n\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\n\n\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\n\n\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\n\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\n\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\n\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\n\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\n\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\n\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\n\n\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\n\tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\n\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\n\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\n\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\n\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\n\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\n\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\n\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be\n\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\n\n\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\n\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\n\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\n\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\n\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\n\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\n\tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect\n\tfrom downstream outlets.\n\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\n\n\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\n\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\n\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\n\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\n\n\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\n\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\n\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\n\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\n\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\n\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\n\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\n\n\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\n\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\n\tfairly resistant to damage.\n\n\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\n\tsheath.\n\t\n\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\n\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\n\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\n\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\n\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\n\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\n\n\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\n\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\n\tbut this is technically illegal.]\n\n\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\n\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\n\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\n\tand CEC):\n\n\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\n\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\n\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\n\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\n\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\n\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\n\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\n\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\n\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\n\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\n\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\n\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\n\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\n\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\n\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box\n\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.\n\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\n\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\n\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\n\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\n\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\n\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\n\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\n\t      in the breach...]\n\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\n\t      similar finish.\n\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\n\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\n\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\n\t      than 1m (39\").\n\n\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\n\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\n\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\n\tthe insulation.\n\n\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\n\tsolid wall coverings.\n\n\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\n\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\n\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\n\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\n\twire.\n\n\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\n\n\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\n\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\n\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\n\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\n\twiring section.]\n\n \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\n \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\n \tpurpose.\n\n\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\n\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\n\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\n\tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\n\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\n\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\n\t\n \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\n \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\n \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\n\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\n\n\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\n\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\n\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\n\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything\n\tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.\n\n\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\n\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\n\n\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\n\n\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\n\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\n\t\n\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\n\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\n\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]\n\nSubject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\n\n\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\n\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\n\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\n\tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.\n\n\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\n\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\n\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\n\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\n\n\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\n\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\n\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\n\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\n\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\n\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\n\n\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\n\n\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible\n\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\n\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\n\tget nasty.\n\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\n\n\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\n\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\n\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\n\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\n\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\n\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\n\twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\n\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\n\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\n\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\n\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\n\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\n\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\n\n\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\n\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\n\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\n\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\n\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\n\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\n\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\n\tmounted between the joists.\n\n\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\n\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\n\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\n\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\n\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\n\t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\n\twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*\n\tlong)\n\n\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\n\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\n\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\n\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.\n\tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't\n\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\n\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get\n\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\n\tin later.]\n\n\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\n\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\n\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\n\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\n\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\n\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\n\tfor the sensor can vary.\n\n\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\n\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.\n\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\n\n\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\n\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\n\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\n\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\n\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\n\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\n\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\n\n\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\n\tand have them come and check out the problem.\n\n\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\n\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\n\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\n\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\n\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\n\n\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\n\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\n\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\n\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\n\n\tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\n\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\n\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\n\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\n\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\n\n\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\n\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\n\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\n\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\n\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\n\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\n\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\n\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\n\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an\n\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\n\n\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\n\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\n\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\n\n\tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there\n\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\n\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\n\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\n\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\n\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\n\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\n\n\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\n\tthan 50 feet long.\n\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\n\n\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\n\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\n\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\n\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\n\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\n\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\n\n\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\n\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\n\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\n\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\n\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\n\tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that\n\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\n\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far\n\tmore current than it can continuously.\n\n\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\n\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,\n\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\n\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\n\n\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\n\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\n\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\n\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\n\n\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\n\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\n\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\n\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\n\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\n\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\n\t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can\n\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\n\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\n\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\n\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\n\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\n\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\n\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\n\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\n\t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\n\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\n\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't\n\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\n\t       on BX cable.\n\n\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\n\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\n\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\n\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\n\tShould the test button work?\n\n\tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\n\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's\n\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\n\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\n\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\n\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require\n\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\n\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\n\tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially\n\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\n\n\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\n\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\n\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\n\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\n\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\n\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\n\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\n\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\n\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\n\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\n\tit, and promised to investigate.)\n\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\n\n\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\n\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\n\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\n\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\n\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\n\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\n\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\n\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\n\twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\n\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\n\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\n\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\n\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\n\tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\n\n\tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the\n\tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.\n\tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\n\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\n\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\n\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\n\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\n\twrong.\n\n\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\n\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\n\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\n\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\n\n\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\n\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\n\tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you\n\tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled\n\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\n\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much\n\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\n\n\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\n\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\n\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\n\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\n\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe''\n\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\n\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\n\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\n\t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.\n\n\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\n\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\n\teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop\n\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\n\thave a different idea.\n\n\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\n\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\n\nSubject: Underground Wiring\n\n\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\n\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\n\ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots\n\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\n\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\n\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\n\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\n\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\n\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\n\tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.\n\n\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\n\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\n\tyour specific situation.\n\n\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\n\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\n\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\n\n\tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\n\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\n\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\n\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\n\tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new\n\twiring.\n\n\tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\n\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\n\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\n\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\n\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\n\n\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\n\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\n\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\n\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\n\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\n\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\n\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\n\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\n\tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even\n\tcause a fire.\n\n\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\n\tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of\n\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing\n\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\n\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\n\tfor the following things:\n\n\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\n\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\n\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\n\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\n\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\n\n\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\n\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\n\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\n\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\n\t       up each connection.\n\n\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\n\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\n\n\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\n\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\n\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\n\n\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\n\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\n\t       be repaired.\n\t    \n\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\n\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\n\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\n\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\n\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\n\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\n\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\n\t       you can rent the tool.\n\n\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\n\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\n\t    \n\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\n\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\n    \n\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\n\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\n\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\n\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\n\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\n\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\n\tYou can do this yourself too.\n\nSubject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?\n\n\tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire\n\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\n\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\n\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\n\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\n\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\n\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\n\n\tHere's some hints on what to look for:\n\n\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\n\n\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\n\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\n\t\t  proper marking.\n\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\n\t\t  a GFCI)\n\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\n\t\t- Switched neutrals\n\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\n\n\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\n\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\n\n\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\n\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\n\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\n\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.

Old style wiring\n\t\n\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\n\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\n\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \n\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\n\n\tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called\n\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\n\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\n\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\n\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\n\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\n\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\n\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\n\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\n\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\n\tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\n\tcolour as the hot wires.\n\n\tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.\n\n\tComments on K&T:\n\n\t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\n\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\n\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\n\t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in\n\t\t  quite good condition.\n\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\n\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\n\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\n\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\n\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between\n\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\n\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\n\t\t  any circuit.\n\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\n\t\t  that contain K&T.\n\t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\n\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\n\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\n\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\n\t\n\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't\n\tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should\n\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\n\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly\n\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\n\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\n\t\n\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\n\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\n\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\n\tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.\n\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\n\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole\n\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\n\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\n\n\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\n\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\n\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\n\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\n\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\n\ttubing.\n\n\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\n\tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\n\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard\n\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\n\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\n\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.\n\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\n\n\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\n\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\n\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\n\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\n\tknow what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable\n\tsales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.\n-- \nChris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541\nPsroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca\nFerret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca\n"}, {"text": "From: kolstad@cae.wisc.edu (Joel Kolstad)\nSubject: Re: 8x oversampling CD player\nOrganization: U of Wisconsin-Madison College of Engineering\nKeywords: oversampling, CD, digitized audio\nLines: 40\n\nIn article <hcbC5un9L.DD0@netcom.com> hcb@netcom.com (H.

When I asked, people said that the\ninterpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\ncomplicated.\n\nAnyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\nsampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\nantialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\noversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of\nall other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should\nallow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias\nfiltering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad\n"}, {"text": "From: squraishi@TrentU.CA\nSubject: Organization of Islamic Conference\nReply-To: squraishi@TrentU.CA\nOrganization: Trent University, Peterborough\nLines: 9\n\nDear Friends,\n\nHi!\n\nI need some information about the Organization ofISlamic Conference (OIC).

McManus, National President of the John Birch Society\n>\n\n\nWhen McManus says, \"We have the world's best medical care,\" I can hardly\nbelieve he's referring to a system:\n\n1.  That costs us 14 percent of our GDP, while there isn't a\n    single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than\n    10 percent.\n\n2.  That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage, even though all\n    the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone.\n\n3.  Yet, Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life\n    expectancy, childhood immunization rate, infant mortality, and many\n    preventable diseases.\n\n4.  We pay, on average, about $1000 each for MRIs.  (To put that in\n    perspective, they cost $177 in Japan.)\n\n5.  The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on\n    health benefits.  Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere\n    else.\n\n\nHow can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world?  The only\nthing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients\nwith a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it.  And\nthe \"private\" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient\nthat it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every\nother sector of society - individuals, government, and industry.\n\nOf the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health\ncare costs last year, the Consumer's Union estimated that at least 200 billion\nwas thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and\nprocedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world.\n\nThere are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA.  But did the\n\"private competition\" stimulate more efficient paperwork?  Ask any doctor\nwho's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all!\n\nThe competition among hospitals is driving costs UP, not down.  The\ncompetition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the\nhospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment.  Spending millions on\nexpensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle\nisn't my idea of the world's best health care system.\n\nCompetition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and\nexpensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful.  I'm especially\nthinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and\nCesarean section.  Sound like the world's best health care system?\n\n\n\nEver notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change in\nhealth care, the Libbies start bashing Canada's system?  First of all, Hillary\nClinton is not advocating another Canadian system.  I think that's been made\nabundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months.  Where did John F.\nMcManus get that idea, anyway?\n\nLet's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border.  Your\nchild needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals.  The\nnearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there's an\nAmerican city one hour south.  Which way are you going to go?  Is it because\nthe American system is the \"best\" in the world, or just for convenience?\n\nIt still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and\nwhite on health care reform.  There are a million different ways we ould\nrestructure the system.  It's not just a choice between total government\ncontrol and total private control.  I wish the people screaming \"socialized\nmedicine\" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM\nTHEMSELVES on health care issues.\n\n\n\nThe current system sucks.  I want to keep providers private but that doesn't\nchange the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we\ndon't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  Purely private health care without any\ngovernment intervention doesn't work.  Hillary Clinton is not thinking of\nnationalizing providers or evern insurers.  How can you scream \"socialized\nmedicine\" at her programs?  Don't you even know what you're talking about?\n\n\n\nEver see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the\ndecade?  Notice how the line falls, then starts increasing?  Why?  I'll give\nyou one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we\ndon't do something about it.\n\n\n\nPEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.  The current health care system is a cancer which is\nkilling our economic well-being.  Costs are still rising 10 percent a year\neven as Americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced into\nmanaged-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if you\nask me.\n\nA couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to please\ncome forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how THEY would set\nabout keeping costs down.  I didn't get a single answer.\n\nThe only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases\nfilled with evasive platitudes like \"give health care back to the people.\"\nJust do you expect to do that without serious reforms?  What is it about the\ncurrent system that you would change and how would that help?\n\n\nHow can anyone read the news, live under our system, and NOT see these faults?\nHow can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, our\ninfrastrucure, AIDS, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don't quit throwing\naway money which could be used to SOLVE those problems?\n\n\nAmerica needs health care reform NOW.

It implies that they have souls, but it does not say they\n>have souls. And it is not given that the quote above is given a high\n>priority in all interpretations.\n\nOne must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach\nto the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it\nthat women and men are spiritual equals.\n\nI think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have\nsouls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be\nforgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the\nafter-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the\npart saying \"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\"\nsays they have souls.  \n\n(If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then \nI have no idea _what_ a soul is.)\n\nAs for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority\nin all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give\nall verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to\nMuslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,\ndenying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be\nconsidered a disbeliever in Islam.\n\n>Quite similar to you other post, even when the Quran does not encourage\n>slavery, it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to\n>slavery. It is a non sequitur.\n\nLook, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and\nthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the\nQuran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly\nanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings\nit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals\nof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that\nsince women can clearly be \"forgiven\" and \"rewarded\" they _must_ have\nsouls (from the above verse).\n\nLet's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than\ntry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this\npassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on\nignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations \nfully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these\ninterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can\nignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try\nto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but\nprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\n\n Fred Rice\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n"}, {"text": "From: paull@hplabsz.hpl.hp.com (Robert Paull)\nSubject: Re: FBI Director's Statement on Waco Standoff\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Palo Alto,CA\nLines: 14\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1.4 PL6]\n\nMr. Nice Guy (rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu) wrote:\n: The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start\n: violence.\n:  \n: When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back.\n: But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for\n: their wounded.

The question, really, has to do with the\nstatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\n\"deuteroncanonicals\" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\n\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\namong the Greeks.\n\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\n\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\ncourse, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it\nwould seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the\nHebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which\nled to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.\n\nBTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of\ntranslation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,\nabove) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two\nof four have been published so far.\n-- \nMichael L.
