To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so\nthat they will know the names of people to convert.

However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows\nprogramming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with\nthe native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the\nsake of changing the API, are valuable.\n\n  Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the\nmemory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less\nimportant. \n\n  We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch\ncomponents from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff\n (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.\n\nThe two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two\ntoolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if\nanyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).\n\nA couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:\n\nZApp\n----\n  Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and\n    also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.\n  Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.\n  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)\n  Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)\n  Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.\n  Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.\n \nZinc\n----\n  Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)\n  Comes with a interface builder tool\n  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)\n  Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.  \n  Had a better demo :-)\n\nBoth have source code availability options\nBoth are lacking OLE support\nNeither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff\n\n\nAny thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,\n\nThanks,\n  Brett Harper\n\n\nbrett.harper@cimlinc.com\n"}, {"text": "From: u0mrm@csc.liv.ac.uk (M.R.

And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the\ntime at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)\n\nSo, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that\nMSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.\n\nStick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly\nharms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should\nbe tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.\n\n-michael\n\n-- \nMichael M.

Beyond that, I have no other info.\n\nThe sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of\nthe orbit of Mercury.\n\nThe idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed\nperihelion precession and the value it should have had according to\nNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\nafoot with Mercury.\n\nBut alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\ncurved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\nand Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \ngeometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of\nit's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession\nof Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's\nnumbers rather than Leverrier's.)\n\nOf course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent\nefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar\nhave been fruitless.\n\n-Bill Gawne\n\n \"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe\n  are the laws of the universe.\"                       - G.

However, discerning\nexactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so\neasy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should\nbehave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances\nat the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and\ncover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward\nothers.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived\nfrom absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to\nstrive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world\npeace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)\n \n>Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \n>to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\n>Can you reconcile this?\n\nSure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those\ntruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does\npreach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal\nclear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to\neveryone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is\nlargely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers\nare speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is \nwhere scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.  \n \n>It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based \n>on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  \n\nGod revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.

It is a\nbit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you\nanyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might\nbenefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.\n \n=======================================================================\n \n                   D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?\n \n \nQ. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,\n   tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \"God Loves You.\"  Isn't\n   that true?\n \nA. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read\n   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:\n \n      For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten\n      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but\n      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16\n \n   However, God's love is qualified.  The Bible says:\n \n      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he\n      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9\n \n      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of\n      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6\n \n \nQ. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good\n   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How\n   can these verses apply to me?\n \nA. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is\n   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The\n   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.\n   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before\n   God.\n \n      As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There\n      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after\n      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11\n \n      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately\n      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9\n \n \nQ. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?\n \nA. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will\n   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.\n \n      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\n      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,\n      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap\n      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They\n      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\n      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of\n      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24\n \n \nQ. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not\n   that bad.\n \nA. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-\n   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible\n   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal\n   and consists of perpetual suffering.\n \n      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was\n      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15\n \n      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\n      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall\n      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and\n      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50\n \n      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with\n      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them\n      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\n      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting\n      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory\n      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9\n \n \nQ. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?\n \nA. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be\n   accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands\n   payment for sin.\n \n      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23\n \n      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;\n      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,\n      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10\n \n      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\n      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n                                                       Matthew 12:36\n \n \nQ. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought\n   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?\n \nA. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our\n   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our\n   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus\n   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.\n \n      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one\n      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of\n      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6\n \n      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\n      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;\n      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5\n \n      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also\n      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the\n      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the\n      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4\n \n      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that\n      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was\n   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about\n   Hell anymore?\n \nA. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it\n   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.\n   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.\n \n      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he\n      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath\n      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36\n \n \nQ. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that\n   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to\n   Hell?\n \nA. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our\n   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole\n   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to\n   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins\n   and serve Christ as our Lord.\n \n      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,\n      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and\n      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n                                                        Matthew 6:24\n \n      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be\n      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the\n      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except\n   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their\n   followers also go to Hell?\n \nA. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-\n   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other\n   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their\n   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and\n   save us.\n \n      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none\n      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be\n      saved.                                               Acts 4:12\n \n   Jesus said:\n \n      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the\n      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6\n \n      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us\n      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n                                                          1 John 1:9\n \n \nQ. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?\n \nA. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You\n   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see\n   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.\n \n      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\n      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,\n      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13\n \n      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe\n      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...\n                                                       Acts 16:30-31\n \n \nQ. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?\n \nA. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He\n   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that\n   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.\n \n      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of\n      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8\n \n   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,\n   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you\n   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is\n   the only Word of God.\n   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented\n   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.\n \n      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of\n      God.                                              Romans 10:17\n \n \nQ. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?\n \nA. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging\n   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.\n \n      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a\n      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17\n \n   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin\n   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we\n   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins\n   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to\n   Hell.\n \n      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him\n      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his\n      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26\n \n \nQ. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be\n   baptized?  Will these save me?\n \nA. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.\n   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's\n   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-\n   ure.  Salvation is\n \n      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9\n \n \nQ. What else will happen at the end of the world?\n \nA. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed\n   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-\n   more.\n \n      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\n      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:\n      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are\n      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\n      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be\n      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\n \n \nQ. What will happen to the earth at that time?\n \nA. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens\n   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-\n   more.\n \n      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in\n      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and\n      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and\n      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...\n      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new\n      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\n                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13\n \n \nQ. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will\n   come?\n \nA. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to\n   save.\n \n      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\n      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end\n      come.                                            Matthew 24:14\n \n \nQ. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?\n \nA. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing\n   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the\n   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not\n   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the\n   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be\n   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.\n \n      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden\n      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with\n      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3\n \n      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his\n      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7\n \n \nQ. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.\n \nA. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to\n   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.\n \n      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he\n      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be\n      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4\n \n \nQ. What did the people of Nineveh do?\n \nA. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented\n   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.\n \n      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry\n      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil\n      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can\n      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his\n      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9\n \n \nQ. Did God hear their prayers?\n \nA. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.\n \n \nQ. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-\n   ment?\n \nA. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has\n   become very short.\n \n      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\n      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed\n      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3\n \n      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,\n      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye\n      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for\n      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8\n \n \n \n \n            A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?\n \n \n \nA  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical\ninformation that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor\nchanges  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing\nand  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph\nwhich  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the\ntext.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they\nappear here as indented paragraphs.\n \n \nI have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual-\nly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what\nthe  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that\nthere  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed\none  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these\nmatters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,\nit  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our\neternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more\nsenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with\nrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\nmade by people on this subject:\n\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\n\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\n\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\nclue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\n\n>the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has \n>kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was \n>changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!\n\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\n\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\n\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\n\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\n\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\ndominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.\n\nSincerely,\n-Josip\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: bskendig@netcom.com (Brian Kendig)\nSubject: Re: To Rob Lanphier\nOrganization: Starfleet Headquarters: San Francisco\nLines: 41\n\nbrian@lpl.arizona.edu (Brian Ceccarelli 602/621-9615) writes:\n>\n>Kent, with regards to the information contained in the Bible (which\n>is the original context of this thread), Brian Kendig is inside a huge\n>wall.

The conditions were\nwonderful, thanks to our Armenians, who received us. But it's not relaxing all\nthe same. I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but for me it's \ntorture. We don't have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment \nin Sumgait, my children went to school and we lived well, in friendship. It's \npainful that in our times, in 1988, in the Soviet period, people can break \ninto our apartment and try to kill me and my children, in whom I've put all my\nefforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older \ndaughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter \nmedical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick \nfor a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my \nlife: it's been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by \nmyself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there's nothing to be done about\nit. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on \nFebruary 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it's indescribable.\n\nOn February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She's better friends with\nmy oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, \"Where's Vika?\" I say,\n\"Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she's supposed to come back\ntomorrow.\" My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talking\nand laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home.\n\nThey left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to\nthe balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at the\ncorner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of\npeople near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they're\nshouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. I\nask, \"Nufar, what's happened?\" He says, \"I don't know, I can't figure it out\neither.\" I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run after\nthem, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's the\nkids. \"Mamma,\" says Gayane, \"you'll never believe what's going on out there! \nIt's awful!\" Ira says, \"Aunt Zina, they're shouting, 'Karabagh! Karabagh! \nKarabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to \ndrive out the Armenians and slaughter them.\"\n\nI called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, \"Aunt Tamara, \ndon't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later.\" I \ncouldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried about\nVika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?!\n\n-Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was \nhappening, although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't \n50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear \neverything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading \nall the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on \nthe bus, then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . .\n\n-Zinaida: It's called slaughter.\n\n-Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they \nwere killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving,\nas though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they \nstarted dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not \ndoing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob.\n\nIt was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you \ncouldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything\nso as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us\nwas the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would be\ndone about it. Where in the world was our government?!\n\n-Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn't\nhome. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday \nmorning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, \"Zin', you know they \nwent into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his \nfather and two sons.\" Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on \nthe first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight!\n\nI saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting \"Slay the\nArmenians! Karabagh is ours!\" This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the \nway I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, \"They beat our store\nmanager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an \nAzerbaijani.\" And I asked, \"Did they kill him?\" She says, \"No, he's in serious\ncondition.\" I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the\nmob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the \nlittle way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but \nthese weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened\nthat I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn't feel my legs or the \nground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my \neyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, and\nthe mob surged toward him shouting, \"He's an Armenian, get him!\" He wore a \nblack coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They \ngrabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.\n\nI made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my \nthoughts. I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus \nand she'll be gone. There's no police, no protection, nothing. It's like they \nhad all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can't even\nfind the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the \nbus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. So\nthis Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are running\ntoward it yelling, \"Armenians out!\" And I see them take the Armenians and beat\nthem, killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just \ncouldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her.\nShe says, \"Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what's happening, I have to\nsee it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children \nwill know.\"\n\nGayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people\nbefore my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . .\n\n-Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn't \nmake anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He\nwas 18 or 19 years old.\n\n-Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy, \nin a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an\nArmenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him \nright under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been \nmuch left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks\none person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a \nsimilarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black \ncoats. You couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they\nall looked alike.\n\n-Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and \nhe cried \"Mamma!\" I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful \nlot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy, \nseveral people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once, but \nwhen that boy cried \"Mamma!\" I immediately started watching only him.\n\n-Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until\ntwelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.\nThey were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact\nthat by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven\no'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their\npositions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter-\nsection again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From\nmorning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine\no'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people in\nthe crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.\n\n-Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a \ncross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross,\nevidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the\nAzerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and started\ntheir pogrom.\n\n-Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his \nnationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. \"But what is your\nnationality?\" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, \"Ermeni,\nErmeni!\" And he says, \"What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't live\nin Sumgait.\" \"Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait.\"\nAnyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a \nwoman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and \ntook the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and \nthen burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone \nran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later \nanother car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting \"Ermeni! \nErmeni!\" But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn't\nbeat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged \nfrom the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too, \nacquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, \"Yes, \nthey burned them along with the car.\" About two hours later a whole wedding \nprocession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they \nwere Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis, \nand they were immediately allowed through.\n\n-Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' The\nwhole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.\n\n-Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard\nof our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele-\nbrating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people were\nbeing killed, and people were celebrating the whole time.\n\n-Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and \nfind out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her \ngirlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third \nfloor. Gaya came back and said, \"Mamma, the bus is supposed to come around\neight, after eight.\" You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was:\nVika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. \nThen I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of \nour neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were \nthrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I \nstarted to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not \nhere, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: \"Mamma, \nnothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company, \nthey'll look out for her.\"\n\nDiana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the\nbalcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then \nthey came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here.\n\n-Zinaida: You're right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th.\n\nDiana: There's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees\nplanted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building.\nAll the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lot\nof Armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few Armenian families, \neither.\n\n-Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many \nof them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them.\n\n-Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that \ntwo people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that \n. . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the \nbuzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our \ncourtyard, howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this \npoint we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the \nbedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the \nsecond and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I \nrealized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, \"Gaya, \nhide the gold.\" That's honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I \ndidn't know what to do! Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting \ndark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it \nwas.\n\n-Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow \nstation to the Azerbaijani one.\n\n-Zinaida: And turned it up loud.\n\n-Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn't do much for \nus. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we would\nwatch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was \nit. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were \nAzerbaijanis.\n\n-Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they're slaughtering Armenians, robbing them, \nand we're listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighbors\nsuggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on \nAzerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they \ntold us, so they will think you're not Armenians. They're saying the Armenians\nare afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding.\n\n-Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed \nthat the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the \nAzerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on.\nWhen we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and\nlater, another one. \"Turn on the lights,\" they told us, \"please. Nothing will\nhappen. Be calm. Nothing will happen.\"\n\n-Zinaida: \"We won't allow them to come into your apartment.\"\n\n-Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them.\n\n  -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left for\nArmenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. The\nAzerbaijanis were crying, saying, \"Can it be there is no God? How could\nthey raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm,\nyou never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune,\nor in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you \ndown the river?\" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, but\nothers gave us away. They sold us down the river.\n\n-Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became \ncautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don't \nwear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the \nAzerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt, \notherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There was\nnothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into \nGod knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head.\n\n-Zinaida: And she told me, \"Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other \nroom. You two look more like Armenians. They'll figure out that we're \nArmenians right away.\" But how could I go away and leave her there?!\n\n-Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were \nthe only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were \nthe only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis, \nwould fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone \ncrawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony.\nWhen we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and \nwe would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned around\nand saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, \"What \nnationality are you here?\"\n\n-Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.\n\n-Gayane: \"What nationality are you?\" he's shouting. Well at first I was\nfrightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect \nAzerbaijani, \"You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that.\nCan't you see I'm an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to \nmeet you face to face and look you in the eyes?\" He looks at me and tells the\npeople with him, \"Yes, Azerbaijanis live here.\" From below they tell him,\n\"Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians.\" And he asks me again,\n\"What nationality are you?\" I say, \"Can't you see?\" I started fuming. I could\nnot say anything else. \"You're blind, that's for sure! You can yell all you\nwant, but that won't make us Armenians.\" I hear them breaking down our\ndoor, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, \"I don't have time to deal\nwith you, they're breaking down our door.\" 1 go to the door and ask, \"Who is\nit?\" They answer, \"Open up!\" I say, \"Wait, why are you breaking the door?\nWhat's going on? I'm opening up.\" We never locked the lower lock, it was\nbroken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn't get it open. I\nsay wait, I'm looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost broken\ndown already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, \"What's going on?\nWhy are you breaking down our door?\"\n\n-Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They're shouting, \n\"Why don't you open the door?\" And I say, \"Well you've already come in the \nbalcony.\" Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the\ndoor. Gaya cries out, \"Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!\" I ran to the door \nand forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian: \n\"Diana, open the door!\" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I'm shouting with\ntears in my eyes for Diana to open the door.\n\n-Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That \nguy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They \nput it up to Mamma's stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and \nslammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, \"Mamma,\nthey want to kill you!\" And then . . . then they started shouting, \"Give us \nyour passports.\" And Gaya says, \"What do you need passports for, we're \nAzerbaijanis.\"\n\n-Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was trying\neverything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself, \nbecause at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To be\nhonest I didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would \nsurvive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, \"What, don't \nyou understand anything?\" They started shouting, they were tremendously \nexcited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their \ngirls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why \nshouldn't they do the same to us? I said, \"Who's doing all that? Who is doing \nit? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I'll\ncut my own face.\" \"Now you calm down,\" they tell me.\n\nZinaida: I told them, \"Why didn't you deal with them there! There, in \nKarabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we \nwith the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn't you give it right back to\nthem there? What've we got to do with this?\" I got confused. I had been\nsaying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as though\nI were an Armenian, but they didn't notice. One of them was next to me,\nwith a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, \"What pretty girls.\" He\nmeant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring \nthem that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad \nlooks.\n\n-Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, \"Young man, I don't have my \npassport here.\" He says, \"Let's have the passport, we won't believe you\nwithout your passport.\" And one of them started hurriedly searching for\ndocuments. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the \npicture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling\nand shouting, \"Passport! Passport!\" They all started yelling, there was so \nmuch noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end. \nSuddenly I said, \"Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a \nMuslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, \nyou've disgraced your honor.\" And then Mamma started to cry.\n\n-Zinaida: I started crying: \"My husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed,\naren't you ashamed of yourselves!\" In fact my husband had died seven years\nearlier, in 1981. \"We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-\nments. The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension.\"\nWell it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, \"They're Lezgins.\nCan't you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave.\" Another fellow in\nthe group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a third\nsaid, \"No, they're Armenians.\" Well the other two convinced him, I don t know \nhow, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of \nthem, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was \nfilled. They started leaving. Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins.\" They started\nleaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had \nfirst called us Lezgins says, \"Leave that, what are you doing?\" They seemed to\nobey that guy.\n\n-Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat.\n\n-Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think.\n\n-Gayane: No, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he \nwasn't a bad-looking sort. He didn't have anything in his hands.\n\n-Zinaida: He stood at the threshold.\n\n-Gayane: Yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed \nfamiliar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can't \nremember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he \nwouldn't be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and \nthat they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. They\ncontinued to argue on their way out. Some said, \"They're Armenians all the \nsame.\" And that fellow answered, \"even if they are Armenians, it's shameful,\nthe father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house, \nthere's no men. We should stay out of the apartment.\" \"What do you mean, stay \nout? We can go in there!\" And he said, \"No, we should stay out, they're \nLezgins, we're leaving here.\" The three of them protected us.\n\n   -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in the\ngrey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well they\nwere all young really. The two of them defended us.\n\n-Diana: Three, three!\n\n-Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana?\n\n-Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes.\n\n-Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat.\n\n-Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When \nthey left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran \nback and said that they were going to kill us.\n\n-Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and I\nclosed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, \"Take Diana and go\ninto the other room.\" My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened the\ndoor. There was a guy there who said, \"Run, hide! They're coming to kill you \nnow!\" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there,\nAzerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. \nI was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything \nto take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been \npreparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn't\nsee anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and \nDiana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, \"Should I close the door \nand leave everything like this?\" He says, \"What do you mean, door? Get out of \nhere, they're coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?\" And I ran \nafter the children.\n\n-Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into \nour apartment and started shouting, \"Where are the Armenians?\" We were already\nat the neighbors'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, \n\"Don't you worry, I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what.\"\n\n-Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,\nto go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. I dissolved in\ntears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I'm\nalready thinking that I've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I \nstill believe she's alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of my\nmind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with\npeople, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment \nwe were hiding asked the bandits, \"Where are those Armenians, the ones who \nwere at home? Where did they make off to?\" They told him they didn't know. \nThey asked him where he lived. He answered, \"Can't you see, on the third \nfloor.\" He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. We\nheard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color \ntelevision off the balcony and it exploded.\n\n-Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we brought\nher around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the \ndoor to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling \nVika. She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughts\nwere only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, \noffering tea.\n\n-Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I are\nalive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and \nburning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us \nand said, \"How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some \nother woman instead. You're from our part of the building you lost your \nhusband, you have children, thank God you're not in her position, we wouldn't \nhave been able to take it. I don't know what I would do.\" He of course \nwouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard \nthey were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth \nfloor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their \nthree children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayed\nwith their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an\naxe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the \nhusband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning \nthings; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted, \n\"Look at the naked Armenian!\" They were going to throw the poor woman into the\nfire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she \ncovered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. \nAll the neighbors saw and heard it . . .\n\n-Gayane: Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing\nthere, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them \ninto her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she \nlives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina \nshowed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was \ncovered, riddled, with wounds.\n\n-Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one\no'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then I\ndidn't care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn't let me go, and\nthe neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be\nslain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about\nthem, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her torn\nto pieces, I'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand I\nwould have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I was\ngoing to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: \"Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of \nyou!\" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we \nheld on that way till morning.\n\nOn the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to\nour apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go \nhimself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to\nme. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too, \nstole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I \ndidn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far \naway, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my \nwork in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time \nbecause of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in the\ntransport division -- and my trip sheets.\n\n-Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work \naround the clock to do her job.\n\n-Zinaida: I look around and I can't find the briefcase. I didn't care about \nthe fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that\neverything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about that\nlater, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into the\nkitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and \nmy earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,\n\"Mamma, hurry.\" And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found  her coat among \nthe debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her \ndresses.\n\n-Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started \nthrowing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television onto\nthe asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then, \nwhen Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't \neat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies\nand gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day \nand everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my \nbooks, but I didn't see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to take\ntwo cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own \ndresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there \nwasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one \nthat had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome. \nI had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one \nwas yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a \nviolin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other \none were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy \nwith their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels. \nThey were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the \nbedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my \nbirthday, they weren't around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and \nthey disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of \nKarlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the \nother books were gone.\n\n-Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor\narrived. He had waited for me until nine o'clock, but I didn't appear, and he\nthought something must have happened, so he came. He's a Russian, Aleksei \nSemyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw \nmy wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. \nWhen I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of \nthem were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my \ndocuments and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I \nremember it it's both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had \nreturned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? \nIncidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things were\ngone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon, \nthe neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. \"I'm afraid,\" he \nsaid, \"that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you\nand us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don't \neven know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I \ndon't know what to call them, I can't find the words, they were everywhere. \nWhere should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my \neyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, \"Go to Alik's, he's an\nAzerbaijani, too.\" and I say, \"You should have said that earlier, when my \nsupervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him.\" Everyone \nfeared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and \nstood. And he says, \"any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But \nright now, I'm sorry . . . \" Then another door opened, also on the third \nfloor. I ask the neighbor, \"Tayara, can we hide at your place?\" She's an \nAzerbaijani too. She says, \"What kind of question is that? Come in!\" She hid \nus. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the \nwardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the \nchild could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us \nout, and when they came back she would hide us again.\n\nWe sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed \nher to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn't eaten or \ndrunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all \nof it just snapped in me. Tayara's husband went outside, even though I begged \nhim to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he'd be \nin the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put \nher passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came \nin she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to \nthe window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that \nsomeone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put \non a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there was\na 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted \nthat someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on \nlooking.\n\n-Diana: I watched too.\n\n-Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiers\ndidn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks at\nthe soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended\nthemselves . . . I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from my\nchildren. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to\nstop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their\nshoes . . .\n\n-Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned \noff the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block \n36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside.\nThe mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob\nsurged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several \nAzerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and they\ncracked open another's head . . .\n\n-Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that's just\nwhat it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shields\nand clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard.\n\n-Gayane: Don't compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations, \nbut these?!\n\n-Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They \nattacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where's the\ntear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used \ngas on those jackals they all would have scattered.\n\n-Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since \nmorning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. They hadn't eaten, they were fine \nstanding there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren't \neven allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and \nthen the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were \nbunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their \nshields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.\nAnd those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhile\ntanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, \"Our \nchildren have never seen war.\" I never even dreamed about it, there was no \nneed to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. It\nwas truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their \nclubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were \ncovered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own \nclubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, \nthey couldn't open fire. They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us. \nIt's comical . . .\n\n-Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny?\n\n-Gayane: No, I didn't mean that: How could something like that happen during \nour Soviet period? It's painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored \npersonnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, \"Get away, it's going to blow!\" \nEveryone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The \nsoldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the \nbus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk.\n\n-Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The \nbus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel \ncarriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over \nthree, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on \nour street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one \nof the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over\nseveral over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the bus\nploughed into a book kiosk.\n\n-Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight \ninto it.\n\n-Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the\nmiddle of the road and set it on fire.\n\n-Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and \ntake them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests.\n\n-Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his \nwife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking \nfor the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and they\nwere saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor \nTayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I \nwould remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we \ngo?\n\n-Gayane: She didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but \nshe was afraid.\n\n-Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at\nnight we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said \nthat a curfew had been imposed. He says, \"Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev \nannounced a curfew.\" And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of \nAzerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in \nKarabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there\nhadn't been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were \nAzerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we \nlearned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard \nagain, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one \nArmenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one \nleft. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed.\n\n-Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and\nfound two bandits. They asked her, \"What are you doing here\" Tayara answered, \n\"I came to take something for myself.\" \"Take all you want, they're gone now.\" \n\n-Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. \nShe said, \"What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children,\nnothing remains of your entire apartment.\" In short, we calmed down, and the \ncrowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don't know \nwhat went on there.\n\n-Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse:\nthey were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn't know \nthe city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets,\nbut didn't go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee \nthey asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way.\n\n-Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.\n\n-Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City \nParty Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1, \nwhen I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said, \n\"Get your things together, they have sent buses for us.\" As it was we had been\ndressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.\n\n-Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive \nand well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe \nplace. I both believed it and didn't believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The \nGambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist,\nwas killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the \ngirls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and \nthe girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he \nwas taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna \nVasilyevna, a Russian: \"Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck.\" She kissed \nDiana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be \ntaken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on \nanother one. It was pouring rain.\n\n-Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, \nand they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, \nmany of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the \nsoldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the\ntanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people \nand they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a \nmattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And they\nwere fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were\nblowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in\nthe courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a \nstreet, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way \nwere run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already \ndark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran up\nand said, \"Get your clothes on, let's go.\" Gaya was wearing slippers, and I \nhad on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my \nold dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora \nsweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the \nstreet. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved \ndress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, one\nof the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to\nthe other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's\ntrousseau, and he gave me his telephone number.\n\n-Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.\nWe had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, let\nus out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed \nguard. It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. We asked, \"Are \nthese all us? Armenians?\" They answered yes. We were surprised that there were\nso many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn't know \nthere were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never \nnoticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the \nKomsomol from Vika's plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and \nwell. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know, \nafter all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was \njust gone. She didn't believe it completely.\n\n-Zinaida: I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. When\nwe arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! It\nwas the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each \nother and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew \nthat there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken \nwindows. I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was. One woman said \nthat they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of \nthem; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband and\nher son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in \nour microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard \nso many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my \npatience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow came\nto me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a \nsafe place; if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her. We \nwent downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heard\nthe voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I started\nbegging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried to\ntalk me out of it: \"I'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, I've looked \nafter her better than a brother does a sister.\" All the same I asked him to \nget her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a \nmeeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the\nCommunist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, \"Give \nme my son back!\", another yelled, \"Where is my daughter?!\", a third wanted her\nhusband . . . Bagirov  was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying \nanything.\n\n-Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, \"To\nRussia!\" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild \nrumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go \nto Armenia. But he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and \nthat he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with \nthem. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our \napartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of \nNasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special \nflights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One \nwoman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko.\n\n-Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but \nthe pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no \ncircumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who will\nanswer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and\ndaughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood? \nSomeone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the \npeople that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn't over yet, now we live \nhere, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. We would like\nto stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will be\nunited.

The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our\n\t\tdoctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a \n\t\tsignificant problem to those who accept the bible as the only\n\t\tsource of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred \n\t\ttraditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no\n\t\tproblem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a\n\t\tunanimous belief among the apostles and all the early \n\t\tgeneration that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul,\n\t\tetc. etc.  It wasn't until the reformation that these doctrines\n\t\twere called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, my\n\t\tpersonaly feelings) if it's a choice between the apostles or\n\t\tLuther, I'll choose the apostles every time, whether or not\n\t\tit is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men\n\t\thave determined to be \"the bible\".\n\n\tLike a said, just a couple of notes.

Previously I\nhad been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU\nbut this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.\n\nYour mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted\nbefore hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.\nI didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher\nspeeds.\n\nParts\n\n\tClock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of\n\tspeeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the\n\toscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend\n\tgetting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.\n\n\t   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for\n\t   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:\n\n\t\t   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)\n\t\t   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)\n\t\t   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)\n\n\t   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.\n\n\t   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a\n\t   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)\n\t   \n\tSocket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as\n\t   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins\n\t   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.\n\n\tCooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a \n\t   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had\n\t   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which\n\t   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up \n\t   something similar or risk frying your CPU.\n\t   \nProcedure\n\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.\n\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from\n\tthe back of the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic\n    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,\n\trear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.\n\t\n9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to\n    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.\n\t\n10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of\n    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic\n\tPower light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The\n\tmotherboard then comes directly out.\n\t\n11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the\n    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators\n\tmust be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.\n\t\n\tVery carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of\n\tthe pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure\n\tyour desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.\n\t\n\tI used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is\n\tNOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is\n\ta multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without\n\tproper care.\n\t\n12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.\n\n13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the\n\told clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the\n\tsocket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new\n\t50 mhz clock.\n\t\n14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.\n\t\n14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.\n\n15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother\n    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.\n\t\n16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n18) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.\n\n21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn \n    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,\n\tsomething is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your\n\thandiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.\n\t\n\tHopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and\n\treplace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and\n\tbe astounded. \n\t\n\tYou will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding\n\ta particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up\n\tmight take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since\n\tmodifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single\n\tproblem.\n\t\nGood Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real\nrisk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than\n$50 in parts.\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\n"}, {"text": "From: gonzaled@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (LGV/MC)\nSubject: Re: How can I use the mouse in NON-Windows applications under MS-WINDOWS ?\nOrganization: University of Colorado, Boulder\nLines: 31\n\nkasajian@netcom.com (Kenneth Kasajian) writes:\n\n>wnkretz@ikesg1.energietechnik.uni-stuttgart.de (Oliver Kretzschmar) writes:\n\n\n\n>>   Hey,\n\n>>   could somebody tell me, how it is possible to work with the mouse\n>>   in a NON-Windows application, which runs in an window.

I know it has to have been tough.\n\nThere are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly\nadults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents\ncan cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of\nthe body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions between\nmedications can cause confusion.\n\nAs far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after\nthe drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anything\nto that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that information.\nI can see what I can find...\n\nI can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to\nthe Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is \"Especially useful for agitation\nassociated with senile dementia\"  (p. 400).  It also should not be \ndiscontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lasting\neffects.\n\nBecause so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know\nwhat else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be able\nto answer you better.
