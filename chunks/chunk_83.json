PST\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \non the aid package.\n\n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n\n\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \ntomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \nfront of you.\n\t     \n\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n\t     \n\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \na vastly expanded relationship.\n\t     \n\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n\t     \n\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \nthereafter for the life of the deal.\n\t     \n\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n\t     \n\t     The President has also decided to create a \nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n\t     \n\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \nlaunching.  \n\t     \n\t     The President is also calling for the development of \na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \nRussia.\n\t     \n\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n\t     \n\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \nenvironmental damage.\n\t     \n\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \nproblem full-time.  \n\t     \n\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \nimportant.\n\t     \n\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n\t     \n\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \nconference, the G-7 conference.\n\t     \n\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \nobjectives with you.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n\t     \n\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \nconstruction of that storage facility.  \n\t     \n\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \nlast couple of years.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n\t     \n\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \nas a very important step in that process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \ntoday.  So it's completely new.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \nRussia needs.\n\t     \n\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \nthat are already there?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On that point, should other American companies \nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \nbillion?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \ncurrent year budget costs --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \nwhich the payments are due?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \ngoing to be involved in that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n\t     \n\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \nour own government, but the resources of the American private \nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \ninto that situation?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \ncould promote American grain sales.  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \nfor a concessional loan program.  \n\t     \n\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \nand it's important for the American farm community.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \nis that right? \n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \nthe short-term payments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \nable to do so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \nhave a range from 0 to --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \nsame level of food imports from the West.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \nsome of the other republics?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n\t     \n\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \nsector can do that.  \n\t     \n\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \n\t     \n\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \nsignal to the American business community that we support their \nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \nsupport them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \ndeliver on making Russia a more --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \nthe work.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \nRussian government for distribution at their will?\n\t     \t    \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \nthese programs.\n\t     \n\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \nnoticed.\n\t     \n\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \nPresident has to do on that?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \nyou got here?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \nwe take any action.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \nit stands now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \nthat it was not previously set to be?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \nfunds might be expended.\n\t     \n\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \nfurther our programs.\n\t     \n\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \nfound it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \nFreedom Support Act funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In other words, all of the money is being \ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \nlegislative history of those funds.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     cooperation --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \nhappened here --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \n\t     \n\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \nearmarked and put it into this fund?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \n\t     \n\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \nAnd we'll do it.  \n\t     \n\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     taken it way from any --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \nbut we thought we should now.\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \n\t     \n\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \nis another Clinton initiative.  \n\t     \n\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \n\t     \n\t     I would also say that the President has given \nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \nobjective.  \n\t     \n\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \nassistance package for Russia.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \nRussian government?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \nsource.\n\t     \n\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \nexample of that.\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \nthem together and to focus their efforts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \nup in the next couple of days on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \ntogether for about two weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \nIs that in the out years?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \nthe state industries is important to them.  \n\t     \n\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \n\t     \n\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \nallied governments that are also active.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \nyou came in with?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \nwhich is our base objective here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \nprivatization?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     money for job training for workers whose \njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \nallocated any money for that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \ngovernment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \nsingle --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \nsingle, individual dwellings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \nserved by this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \ndone.  \n\t     \n\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \nspend the money wisely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is it about this program that convinces \nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \nespecially considering their other debt problem?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President say that the value of the \nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \nprogram that does this?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \nyears from now?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \nfrom now to pay back those loans.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     substantial government-to-government loan \nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     government loans in any other sector that \nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\n\t     \n\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \nto say this is a new and unique effort.\n\n                               END10:25 A.M.

Or: \"what the bible teaches according to\nRobert Weiss and co.?\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\n\n(...)\n\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n#  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n#  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may\n#  certainly be.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have\nallowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...\n\n=============================\nRobert Weiss\npsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu\n\n\nCasper C.

North-ame-\nricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average\neuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better \nskater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL\nare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many \nbreakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in\nNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because\nof clumsy defensemen.\n\nI have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars\naren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans\nare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the\nclass of his own). \n\nTommi\n"}, {"text": "From: rvenkate@ux4.cso.uiuc.edu (Ravikuma Venkateswar)\nSubject: Re: x86 ~= 680x0 ??

The University cops here (who are\n>are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most\n>state cops are.\n\nDefine \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\n\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\n\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\n  the trigger again.\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n  to rotate to the next round.\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n  easy motion, even one handed.\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it's jammed!\" before starting to do anything\n  about clearing it.\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\n  of employment as a revolver.\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\nas the timer on a VCR.\n\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\nthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\n\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit\nwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\n\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\n.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police \nprefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....\n\nObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they \n        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking\n        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.\n\n-- \n\"If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect.\"\n\t-BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93, regarding failed raid attempt in TX.\n"}, {"text": "From: mccoy@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (Daniel McCoy)\nSubject: R4 Version of xrecplay\nReply-To: mccoy@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nOrganization: I-NET Inc.\nLines: 14\n\nI have and use xrecplay for X11R5.

The Negev in the Year 2000\n\nJust after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \"the\nJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\" was trumpeted\nthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David\nBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \"It's by our\npioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land\ninto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in\nabandoned desert areas\".\n\nContrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that\nduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for\ncenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found in\nall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys\nof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These\nwere the Bedouin Arabs.\n\nThe real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern\npart, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's\ncultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the\n12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the\nState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond\nrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev\nare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief\nrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture\nlands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and\ndumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli\nJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area\ncultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish\npastoral activity.\n\nI. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin\nbefore and after 1948\n-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,\naccording to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba\nsub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or\nSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin\nArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep\nand 22,000 goats.\n\nThe majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in\nthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per\nyear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the\nBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more\nthan double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers\nafter 40 years of \"making the desert bloom\"*\n\nThe Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of\nbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming\ntechniques were primitive, but production was based solely on\nanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal\nproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.\nProduction increased considerably during the rainy years and\ndiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture\nanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight\nquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many\nwaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the\nresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh\nlocal conditions.\n\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\nBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\n10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\n40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\nmm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\nof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\nspring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\nshepherds from roaming.\n\nA few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\nBut after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\nBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\nwas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\nin order that the land could be transferred to the army.\n\nNo reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\ntoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\nthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\nby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\nconfined to seven \"development towns\", or *sowetos*, established\nfor them.\n\n(the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:\nelias@ismennt.is)\n\n"}, {"text": "From: ccdw@kudu.ru.ac.za (Dave Wilson)\nSubject: Xlib timeouts?\nSummary: How to do timeouts using Xlib\nKeywords: Xlib timeouts\nArticle-I.D.: kudu.ccdw.735917051\nOrganization: Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa\nLines: 12\n\nI am in the process of modifying an X application that uses Xlib.

Since the son is allergic it would be best not to go to\nbottle feedings, but rather eliminate foods from mother's diet.

There is not a single\ndocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because\nhe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few\ndocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't\nfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the\nproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely\nprevented the office from getting shot.\n\nThe purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.\nThis does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down\nintentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a\n'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the\nstandpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.\nBy this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.\nFrom the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a\nrevolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of\nfiring it.\n\nThe ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that\nthe firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the\nwide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be\nfamiliar with that particular type of firearm.\n\nRick.\n"}, {"text": "From: mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca (Malcolm Lee)\nSubject: Re: A KIND and LOVING God!!\nOrganization: Royal Roads Military College, Victoria, B.C.\nLines: 39\n\n\nIn article <sandvik-190493200858@sandvik-kent.apple.com>, sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik) writes:\n|> In article <1993Apr19.165717.25790@ra.royalroads.ca>,\n|> mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca (Malcolm Lee) wrote:\n|> > \n|> > It is true what you stated above:  Jesus' saving grace is available to\n|> > everyone, not just Jews.

TIA registers also sat in this address space.\n\nAs 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carried\nRAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line\nto the cart.

Can anybody deny these facts?\n\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \nrevisionists say!\n\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\n\nOK.\n\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\n\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\naway!\n\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\n[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \n\nI don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\n\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\n\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> \nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \nMassachusetts. \n\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\n[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.\n\nMy grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \ntoday.\n\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But\n[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why \n[SY] should they become enemies?\n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\nS.D.P.A.

Since we, as American's, have the \ngurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the\n2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk \nvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with\ndomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.\n  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the \nofficial press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to\npublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.\nSo far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very\nagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their\nadvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they\nwere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification\nwhat so ever of doing what they did.\n   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,\nmay mislead the public from the truth of the matter.\n\nJust as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton\nleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's\n(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be\nunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).\nAnd since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved\nin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to \nfind out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.\nIt would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly\nunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). \n\n\n****************************************************************************\nThe above opinions are mine and mine only.\nI'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\n\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

Most of the other\nmodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.\nI threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\nroots.\n\nThe SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\n\nToyota Paseo\nHonda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si\nNissan NX1600/NX2000\nMazda MX-3\nIsuzu Impulse\nGeo Storm\nFord Escort GT\n\n\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\n\nTercel -> Paseo\nSentra -> NX1600/NX2000\nCivic -> del Sol\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\nStylus -> Impulse/Storm\n\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\nmoney for this type of car.  \n\n\nIn short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it's market\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\nsedan (SL1/SL2) version.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\n\n\nMihir Shah\n\t \n"}, {"text": "From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)\nSubject: Re: Conference on Manned Lunar Exploration.

As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\nGod's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations (\"I\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\n\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: \"Where wast thou\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" Job 38:4-7).  We\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the \"Veil of Forgetful-\nness,\" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\n\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\n\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\n#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\n#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?\n#\n#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd\nas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe\nin the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They\nwill cry \"heresy\" and other accusations of \"perverting\" the doctrines of\nthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as\nfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)\n\nAs for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as\nexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea\nScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not\nleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.\n\n#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.\n#\n#                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that\n#                        he is acting according to God's will, and who there-\n#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by\n#                        stabbing you in the back?\n#\n#                                                        -Voltaire\n\n\nCasper C.
