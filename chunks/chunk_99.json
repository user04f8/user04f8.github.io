I'll tell you \nwhat we've found and the systems we've worked out.\n\n- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider\nto judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something\nand leaning forward.  Remember this.\n\n- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally \nthis means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned\nover and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.\nMuch balance is lost and this can be dangerous.\n\n- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough \nfor the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding \nonto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast\nbecause braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which \nshoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.\n\n- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not \nout wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.\n\n- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.\nNormally this means \"slow down, and do it now!\".  \n\n\n> turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional\n> signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???\n\nWe only have a couple signals.  \"Slow down\" is her either tapping me on \nthe back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency\nof the matter :-)\n\n\"Turn here\" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is\nalso the sign for \"cool!  Look at that.\"  \"I hafta pee\" is the same sign\nas \"turn here\".  \"I'm hungry\" is the same sign.  \"Go faster\" is usually\ndone by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see \"slow\ndown\" more often than \"go faster\".\n \n> I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that\n> she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...\n\nThe best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and \npillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're \nin almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because\nyou as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely\nfeel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes\nat any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  \nPillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.\n\nAlso, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up\nthan by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and\n\"in the Zen of the moment\" less.

We have several\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\n\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\n\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\n\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z\ttcpview and tcpdump source code\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z\tSun4 binaries\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z\tDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\n\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\n- easier interface\n- enhanced protocol decoding\n- hex display of frame\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\n- ethernet address host table\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\n\tprocessing.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\n\nNew features:\n\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the \nfile type will be automatically detected.\n\nCan now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.\n\nThe hex format has been changed.\n\nNew time options have been added.\n\nOptions were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.\n\nBugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)\n\nNew flags:\n-R\tread Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin\n-ttt\tprints delta times\n-tttt\tprints times relative to the first frame\n-W\twrite a Sniffer save file (use with -w)\n-x\tprint frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  \n\tSample output:\n\n16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: S 0:0(0) win 16384\n        0000  45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02   |  E..(....<.|.._p.\n        0010  80 d6 06 64 05 05 00 15 5b 19 4a 00 00 00 00 00   |  ...d....[.J.....\n        0020  50 02 40 00 4e 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         |  P.@.N.........\n\n-X\tprint TCP data in hexdump format (used with -Z)\n-z\twrite TCP data to stdout (use with -t to eliminate timestamp)\n-Z\twrite frames and TCP data to stdout\n\n\nMartin M.

Do you\nfind the exegisis convincing or not?)\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nOne of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and\nothers is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations\nraised by various Bible scholars and students alike.  When I present MY VIEWS,\nI will clearly distinguish them from now on.\n \nDB...\n\"Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented\nno Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not\nreferring back to the actual Greek.  Thus we find this demand on his part for\nquality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nGood point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you\nhave produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug\ndeeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on\nthese passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.\n \nDB...\n\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as\nevidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it\noften enough:\n \n> (a) the text itself\n> (b) parallel passages\n> (c) other pertinent Scriptures\n> (d) historical context\n> (e) historical content\n> (f) other pertinent historical info\n> (g) cultural context\n> (h) cultural content\n> (i) other pertinent cultural info\n> (j) grammatical construction\n> (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies\n> (l) etc.\n \nBut are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's\nsee, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other\npassages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has\npresented no use of:\n \n(d) historical context                or\n(e) historical content                or\n(f) other pertinent historical info   or\n(g) cultural context                  or\n(h) cultural content                  or\n(i) other pertinent cultural info     or\n(j) grammatical construction          or even\n(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]\n \nThus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQuestion:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting\nto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present\nshallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).\nAt this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a\ntotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating\naround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe\nit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:\nJudas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use\nseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.\nIt will greatly enhance our study of these passages.\n \nDB...\n\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other\npassage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is\nred herring and his only real criteria seems to be:\n \n> (a) the text itself\n> (b) parallel passages\n \nMY REPLY...\nThe reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the\nPASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one\nanother.\n(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;\n(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look\nat your defense of this later.\n \nAlso, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of\nsilver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at\nstating why you believe it is).\n \nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\nas he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\npassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's\nexplanation of Judas' death...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\n=============================================================\n \nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\nall.\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\ntrue and supplementary.\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\nthe same time.\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\ncase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\ninerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\nHere's what you said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n> Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks\n> on this way down, tearing his body open.

But you seem to\nfind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\nJoslin's.\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHere, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\nthe passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\nit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it\ndidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\n \nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\nin this respect.\n \nDB...\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\n \n> (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas'\n>     death.  I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas\n>     died in the hanging.\n> (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down\n>     in the temple and the chief priests used, is the \"reward of iniquity\"\n>     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with;\n>     therefore there is a contradiction.  Prove that the 30 pieces of silver\n>     and the \"reward of iniquity\" are one and the same.\n \nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\n \nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\n \n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\nResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\n \nDB...\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nQualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention\nbelow.\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But\nhe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\ndiscover.\n \nDB...\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThank you, Dave.\n \nDB...\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nSo it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's\nposition.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?\n \nAlso, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or\ndeceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done\nwith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including\ntheir \"interpretation\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find\nsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.\n \nYou also noted they \"interpreted\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although\nthat is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?

But Matthew does not state death as being a result.\n \nThe Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New\nTestament.\n \nIn the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\nit's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was\nnot followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his\ncity. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he\nwas buried in his father's tomb.\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nNotice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\nAPAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\nresult.\nIn Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n \nAlso, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply\nmeans \"hang oneself\".\n \nDB...\n\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable\n                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\nChristian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^above, mine]\n\"Reputable\"?  You mean ones that have never erred?\nAs far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,\neven by me. ^^^^^^^^^\n \nAs I said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nAlthough I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable\nexplanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),\nI've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.\n \nMAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and\nsaid, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the\nprice of blood.\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's\nfield, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of\nBlood to this day.\n \nFirst of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of\nhanging. All it says is that he \"went and hanged himself.\" Luke however, in\nActs, tells us that \"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all\nhis entrails gushed out.\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the\nother details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,\netc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that\n                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nMatthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\ncut.\n^^^\n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nI also wrote...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nMY REPLY...\n \nHere we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.\nLet's look at the passage in Matthew:\n \nMAT 27:4 saying, \"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\" And they said,\n\"What is that to us? You see to it!\"\n \nMAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,\nand went and hanged himself.\n \nMAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \"It is not\nlawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\"\n \nMAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,\nto bury strangers in.\n \nMAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\n \nNotice verse 5...\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\"\nMatthew does not say Judas died, does it?

Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging\nand hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be\nthe case.  Therefore, no contradiction.

I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\nmention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!\n \nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\nto those who arrested Jesus;\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be\ndesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'\n \nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\nthat Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\n         ^^^^^^\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\nsaid to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give\nsomething to the poor.\n \nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of\niniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\nby Judas to purchase a field.

We sell\ncommunications boards that use a 68000.  They used to be high tech. Our\nagent in the UK sold a system to a company in CH which packaged it in a\nproduct for CZ (London-Bern-Prague).  I telexed the Brits and told them\nthe Swiss need to pass export paperwork through the US as, at the time,\nyou needed an export lisence for these systems.\n\nNow I knew the NSA was watching this traffic (just like they are watching\nTHIS traffic.)\n\nAnd what do you know... two weeks later an agent of the US government shows\nup in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the Evil\nEmpire, we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly.\n\nHe was part of a FIVE man office in COLUMBUS OHIO!! who did this stuff\nbased on sources he could not reveal. (I assume most of the time these\nguys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there isn't\nthat much stuff coming out of Columbus :)\n\nWow, the electric utility in Prague sure is a big worry for these folks :)\n\nThe point is, we have created a giant bureaucracy (NSA) with a budget\nbigger than the CIA's who, like all bureaucracies, fill their time looking\nfor things to do.  The Evil Empire is gone.  The NSA is not.  They will do\nsomething to fill their time and justify their budgets.  (I just wish they\ntoo would sit around with their thumbs up their ass... but that is too\nmuch to hope for... they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and\nsubvert people like Dorothy Denning.)

It is possible that a 100 watt\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \ncause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \n\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\nToo bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers\nto take any precautions.\n\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\nCB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nDouglas S.

Congressional\nRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what\nthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL \nprojects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package\nwas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the\nWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted\nto Congress.  It didn't work.)\n\nThe $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close\nto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it\nwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and\nat what level.\n\nIn the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever\nexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the \nRepublicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS\nPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total \namount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus \npackage for ALL projects.  \n\nThe plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction\nand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are\nplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the\nbottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million\nor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing\npriorities.\n\nIf the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects\nthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton\nadministration has been publicizing the issue.\n\nA final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is\nworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them\nis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally \nsupported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,\narguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending\npriorities than \"Washington bureaucrats.\"  \n\nIs it clear now?

We cannot currently ship PEM, or even \nsimple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department \nof State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to \ncompete in international information systems markets.\n\nSure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in \nthe USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be \nthe *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to \nhear confession over email.

Some wonder whether or not the moon could\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\n\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\nam not a diving expert).\n\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,\nthe Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a \npressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?\n\nken\nkhayash@hsc.usc.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: rich.bellacera@amail.amdahl.com\nSubject: Part 1 and part 2  (re: Homosexuality)\nLines: 114\nReturn-Path: <amail.amdahl.com!rich.bellacera@juts.ccc.amdahl.com>\n\nTony-\n\nI read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other\ntypical\"Christian\" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their 'cause' and\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\n\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\nin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I've\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\n\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\n\nI'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\noppressive legisation against gays.\n\nPerhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\n\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\nwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\npeople's expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\n\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\nsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\non thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\nGay people are not criminals.\n\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\n\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\nColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\n\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\nembracing.\n\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\ntowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\nexcluding people.\n\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,\nespecially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\nitself.

As it turns \nout, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the \nsetting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently \nalso supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to \nensure the holding of democratic elections in the \nterritories.\"\n\nThus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily \nHadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the \nthinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this \nissue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the \nsettlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the \ndecision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian \npolice force as a significant step towards the instituting of \nreal autonomy, something which will restrict what can be \ndone by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza \nStrip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street \ntheater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian \npolice force', rightwing elements are attempting to \nfrighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go \nback on his decision. Members of the Kach movement \nhave even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the \nOccupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future \nPalestinian police force.\n\nHowever, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the \nnew police force - as far as the Israeli government is \nconcerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over \nwhom they will apparently have no authority, but will \ncontrol political groups within the Palestinian population, \nwhom the government is interested in neutralizing. \nWrites Barzilai:\n\n\"...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting \nup of a local police force in the territories will precede, \nnot only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of \nthe preparing of the interim autonomy agreement.\n\n\"The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a \nlocal Palestinian police force is evidence that the \ngovernment is serious about arriving at a settlement with \nthe Palestinians...\"\n\nIt's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly \nworried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is \ninevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal \nHusseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a \nvariety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would \nlike to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the \nPalestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his \nplans.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nAdd'l comment by E.D.:\nNumerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in \nco-opting some Palestinian\ncircles by this idea. They fear that a Palestinian police \nforce, controlled in fact by Israel, might act even more \nbrutally than the IDF. The idea of using a surrogate police \nforce is not new. It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was \nused by the Nazis to control Jewish ghetto-dwellers.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: u2i02@seq1.cc.keele.ac.uk (RJ Pomeroy)\nSubject: Re: Losing your temper is not a Christian trait\nLines: 72\n\nFrom article <Apr.15.00.58.22.1993.28891@athos.rutgers.edu>, by ruthless@panix.com (Ruth Ditucci):\n> Coming from a long line of \"hot tempered\" people, I know temper when I see\n> it.

The user site can enter their\nsite-specific \"batch profile\" into a dataset within our product, specifying\nthe pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,\netc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is\nwritten to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and\nrun the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as\nthe job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the\ninteractive session.\n\nAs currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80\ncharacters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in\nbatch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a\nproblem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.\nMVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single\ncommand across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is\n*STANDARD* with OS/2).\n\nThe gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not\nwithin my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.\nSince my first posting I've learned that there are several third party\ncompanies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.\nAnd I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative\nscript language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption\nthat they have anything other than what comes with NT.\n\nI saw another post on this list (the subject was something like \"Is vi\navailable for Windows?\") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and\n***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is\nit a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I\ncould count on it at all NT sites.\n\nOne last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,\ni.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run\nthere.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific\ncommands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment\non these commands, I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks again for the help,\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScott Bass                           |  SAS Institute Inc.\nIntegrated Systems, A216, x6975      |  SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC  27513-2414\nsasswb@k2.unx.sas.com                |  (919) 677-8001 x6975\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}]}
