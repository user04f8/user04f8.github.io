P. A1.\n\nNEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE\n\n\t* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage\n\t  by a man who infiltrated political groups\n\nBy Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time\nart dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In\nreality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and\namassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40\nyears.\n\nHis code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was\nso successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen\nto head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi\n(D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.\n\nFor a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White\nAryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he\nobtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. \nAnd he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government\nto trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.\n\nThese are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former\nLos Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with\npolice and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide\nintelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nOfficials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper\nactivity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They\nhave refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.\n\nTranscripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents\nreleased by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details\nof the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line\ninto illegal territory.\n\nAt times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air\nwith laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with\nforeign agents and code names like \"Ironsides\" and \"Flipper.\"\n\nOn one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a\npro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,\nIsrael.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties\nto Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. \nShortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed\nhim.\n\nThe court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA\nagent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing\nconfidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nGerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by\nthe FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its\ncontents included passports, driver's licenses and identification\ncards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for\nfour American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank\nbirth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from\nvarious agencies.\n\nAlso in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a\nblack hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of\nblindfolded and chained men.\n\nInvestigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the\nADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information\non a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one\ntarget group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n\nEach case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would\nconstitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in\nan affidavit for a search warrant.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil\nrights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on\ngroups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's\nfact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a\nreputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with\npolice agencies and journalists. \n\nHowever, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files\non at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United\nFarm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for\nInvestigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the\nAsian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.\n\nThe computer files also included information on several members of\nCongress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman\nRon Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey\nfrom the Bay Area.\n\nIn their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation\nLeague has collected information on political activists in the Los\nAngeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely\nwith three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in\nintelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism\nexpert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence\nofficer.\n\nA spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew\nnothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los\nAngeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the\ninvestigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined\ncomment.\n\nBullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy\ndrama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a\nvolunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a\nbook about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.\n\nBullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by\nthe ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the\nmid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations\nup and down the West Coast.\n\nTo keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled\nthrough Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never\nmissed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.\n\n\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all\nanti-democratic movements,\" Bullock said.  \". . . Officially, I'm only\na contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not\nbe officially connected with me.\"\n\nBullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists\nto Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own\nname but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.\n\n\"I'm one of a kind,\" he told police.\n\nIn recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become\nknown, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a\nshotgun who threatened to kill him.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a\nsynagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and\nmatching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by\npolice.  In part because of this investigation, he became close\nfriends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco\npolice intelligence division.\n\nBullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An\nFBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:\n\n\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and\nwould share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to\nGerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to\nBullock.\"\n\nFrom a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876\nindividuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files\ncontained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.\n\nIn 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of\ninformation to the South African government.  Bullock tells of\nmeetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels\nand receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100\nbills.\n\nBullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled\nonly from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published\nby San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African\nBishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli --\nand submitted it as his own work.\n\nBullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. \nBullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government\nevenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \"I may be gay but I'm a\nstraight arrow.\"\n\nIn his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about\nengaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to\nviolate the law.\n\nFor example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records\nand criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of\nthe confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said\nGerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence\nfiles on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under\ndepartment policy.\n\nBullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation\nof Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San\nFrancisco office.\n\nBullock seemed proud of his \"Operation Eavesdrop,\" in which he used a\npaid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan\nResistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by\nmembers of the right-wing group.  \"For a short time, it was\nwonderful,\" he told police.\n\nIn Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago\nas a \"fact-finder\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go\nundercover to the meetings of target groups.\n\nAmong other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles\nADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \"anti-Israel\nleanings\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such\nsentiment.\n\nGurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he\nattempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a\nrival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for\nHolocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival\nand threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate\ngroup.\n\nGurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the\nprobe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. \nUnlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the\ninvestigation.\n\nGurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed\nby The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.\n--\nYigal Arens\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\narens@isi.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: bck_csm@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu (Brian C.

I see no damage.  \n\nPlease stop pushing your objective morality on others.

Government has developed a microcircuit that not only\n   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust\n   than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of\n   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\nfor the other 40-bit key.\n\nSimilarly, it didn't say \"We're making encryption is commercially available.\"\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\n\nThe next thing it didn't say is \"We're making encryption legal\",\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\nPresident can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\n\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\n\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\n\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\nwhich clearly means \"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\nSoon.  Once business buys into this.\"\n\nAnother thing it didn't say is \"We're going to ask Congress for money\nto do *lots* more wiretapping\", because of course, there's a budget crisis,\nand Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\n   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct\n   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\n   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\n   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\n   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\nwhich means \"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to\nbuy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO\n(that's what \"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\" \nmeans.)  \n--\n#\t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill\n# Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ\n#\t              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....\n# White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461\n"}, {"text": "From: webster@ucssun1.sdsu.EDU (paolini p)\nSubject: ftp:UNIX-dos-UNIX\nOrganization: The Internet\nLines: 13\nTo: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu\n\n\nI'm an new to this.

Fordham) \n\n     The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is \nextremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal \ninfection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \n       =================================================================     \n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \n\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \n      ==================================================================\n                                April 20, 1993 \n      ==================================================================\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \n(Kolata, Gina) \n\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We're delighted to see the  \npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \nMaddox. \n      ================================================================== \n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \net al.) \n\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \nconclude. \n      ==================================================================    \n                                April 21, 1993 \n      ==================================================================    \n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \n(04/21/93), P. 7A \n\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \ninfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily \nfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies \nsince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual \nAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, \nled the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come \ntogether, said participants.

The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first\nin the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term\nbut may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations\nare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the\neightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar\nMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the\nNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is\nsynonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who\noriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans\nand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word\nby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is\nnontheless inappropriate.

Karma is considered to\nbe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape\na person's predilections for future intention and action and\nproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --\n\"reward\" has nothing to do with it.

In fact \"As you\nsow, so shall you reap\" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor\nof natural growth is explicit.\n\nHinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more\ndeterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being\ntheistically inclined.\n\nIn point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia\nconsiders karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in\nfact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics\nof karma without the element of free will.\n\nAlso in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and\nrebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.\n\nIsn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation\namong Christian thinkers?

They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment.

Incidentally, my MP has responded to\nmy questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'\ncountries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will\nget A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with\nA5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the\ncapabilities of the base station.\n\nThe cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to\nlisten in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but \ncellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users\nand fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular\ncalls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another\nbase-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled\ncall *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's\nequipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can\nlisten without having to obtain a warrant.\n\nBut, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant\nto get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see\nabove - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,\nbut even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a\nwarrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,\nit appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop\nlistening in'...\n\nYou have every reason to be scared shitless.

This is often\ninterpreted as the much weaker term religion. \n\nThe atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews,\nMushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a\ndin you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social\ncode. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict,\netc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent\nthose assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other\nMushriq, or roughly polytheists. \n\nThere cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community,\nthat community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate \nthe society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or \"Progress is \nthe natural consequence of Human activity\" or \"parlamentarian\ndemocracy is doubtlessly the best way of government\", however \nthey individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point\nof view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist. \n\"We are a atheist society\" in fact means \"we reject the din other than\nours\". \n\nAtheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/\nsuppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that\nis a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such\ndeviations and disbelief.

I tell you\nthe truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God\nlike a little child will never enter it.\"\n\nThe Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement\nfor baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again,\nregenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the case\nof an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the\nheart of the infant--through the power of the word.\n\nThe Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision.\nCircumcision was the means by which a male infant was made\na part of God's covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to be\nperformed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this,\nand even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the\neighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier.\n\nAaron> Romans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good\nAaron> news.  For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'\nAaron> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the\nAaron> message is heard through the word of Christ.\"\n\nAaron> So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the\nAaron> message of the gospel.  \n\nAnd the gospel is surely preached at any infant's (or adult's)\nbaptism.

So we can have no\nAaron> original guilt from Adam.\n\nHere you show that you just don't understand original sin--\nyou are arguing against a straw man.\nMaybe you've been talking to Catholics too much.  I don't\nknow.  But original sin does not consist of God's imputation\nof Adam's guilt to us.  It consists of our inheritance of\nAdam's sinful nature.  It is actual sin.

At that village, whose name was publicized\nthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had\nfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was\nnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab\ntroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting\nwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated\nthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian\npopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the\nbattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed\nat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,\nchildren and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the\nslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw\naway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own\nrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants\nobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their\nstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy\nwas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent\ntestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to\novercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the\ncivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable\ncasualties.\n\n    \"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of\nrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We\nnever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in\naccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am\nconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single\nunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw\nstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do\nwell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].\n\n    \"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency\nfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.\nBen Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise\nruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise\nruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the\nbodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal\nsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews\nwere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of\n'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave\nof lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'\n\n    \"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the\nresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.\nKolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the\nHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.\nBeit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main\nroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the\nHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the\nrest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even\nbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir\nYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the\nway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir\nYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the\nconquest of Haifa.\"\n\n\n[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \"To counteract the loss\nof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at\nRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by\nIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish\nofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this\nArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced\nto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of\nevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of\nterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at\nthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen\nbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie\nis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\"\n\n[2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews.\n"}, {"text": "From: hilmi-er@dsv.su.se (Hilmi Eren)\nSubject: Re: ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES (Henrik)\nLines: 53\nNntp-Posting-Host: alban.dsv.su.se\nReply-To: hilmi-er@dsv.su.se (Hilmi Eren)\nOrganization: Dept. of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University\n\n\n  \n|>      henrik@quayle.kpc.com writes:\n\n\n|>\tThe Armenians in Nagarno-Karabagh are simply DEFENDING their RIGHTS\n|>        to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are INVADING their \n|>        territorium...\n\t\n\n\tHomeland?

If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP\nfile for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5\") under MS Windows 3.1 via either\nProgram Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell \nhas errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not.\n\nThe corruption is detected by executing \"pkunzip -t b:\\file.zip\" after \nboth copies.  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption.\n\n\nNow here's the kicker:\n\n\nI have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps.\nSupposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the \nDOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).\n\n\nSo, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running,\nand one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive).  Under this \nscenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the Windows\napps and one slice for the running DOS app.  \n\nWhen copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks\nare essentially inactive.  Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and\n95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices.  Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = \n.72 or 72% of the total available CPU time. \n\nWhen copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell\n(no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task\nmanager.  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice\n(assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: \n(1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time.\n\nSo why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU\ntime?
