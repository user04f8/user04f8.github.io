Will anybody\n\nA typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia, \nand today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians\nbrought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced\nnationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods\nthe Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual,\nthey will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag \nis a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with \nno border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides \nthe geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and \nthe 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which \nrenders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or \nher mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event \ncould have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case \nto occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis, \nor put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she?\n\n\n                An Appeal to Mankind\n\nDuring the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational\npopulation are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of\nthe Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights\nguaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,\ndocuments signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.\n\nThe USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan\nthough they are all empowered to take necessary measures to\nguarantee life and peace.\n\nThe 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's\ntacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against\nAzerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied\nand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.\n\nSome 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly\ndeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.\nTogether with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also\nbeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.\nSome 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives \nof other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central\nAsia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee\nthem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.\n\nOne of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against\nAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the\nArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific\nexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection \nof the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.\n\nWe beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,\nfor the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are\nviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,\nits people are shot. There is persistent negative image of\nAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over \nthe whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the\nUSSR and the United States. \n\nOne of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and\ngenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance\nwhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent \nevents stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on\nAzerbaijan.\n\nIt is a well documented fact that before the conflict there\nwere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the\nissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly\nand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their\nrepresentatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan\nSSR.\n\nWe are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we \nare for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one\nof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic \nRepublic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.\n\nBut all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the\nSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists\nencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000\nYear Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the \nneighboring lands.\n\nThe world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,\nsuffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.\n\nBut what about the lives of seven million human beings?\nIf these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are\nless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their \ncolour of skin or religion, by their residence or other\nattributes?\n\nAll people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers\nfor help and understanding. This is not the first appeal\nof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous\nappeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope\nthat the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda\nwill one day reveal the extent of our suffering and\nstimulate at least as much help and compassion for\nAzerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.\n\n\t\tTHE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO \n                KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES \n                OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR\n\n\n\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive.\"\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads.

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\nusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\nquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\n(1.5).\n\n   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\nnicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \n\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\n\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was\nfrom memory!\n\n   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\nhardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \nanimation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?\n\n   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\n\n   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can\nclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in \nmy computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.\n\n   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer\nlow-priced box has a lot of market...

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to\nchronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is\nsomething to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much\nmore frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an\nautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which\nalso leads to cirrhosis.  \n\nOf course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous\neffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. \nPatients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,\namong many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic\ncirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of\nhyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. \nThese effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in\nmen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for\ncirrhosis is liver transplant.\n\nKeep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in\nyour friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the\nsubject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he\nor she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to\nyou, and offer you support.\n\nSimon.  \n"}, {"text": "From: ab@nova.cc.purdue.edu (Allen B)\nSubject: Re: TIFF: philosophical significance of 42\nOrganization: Purdue University\nLines: 20\n\nIn article <1993Apr10.160929.696@galki.toppoint.de> ulrich@galki.toppoint.de  \nwrites:\n> According to the TIFF 5.0 Specification, the TIFF \"version number\"\n> (bytes 2-3) 42 has been chosen for its \"deep philosophical \n> significance\".\n> Last week, I read the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy,\n> Is this actually how they picked the number 42?\n\nI'm sure it is, and I am not amused.

The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and\nthey agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in\nEnglish) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check\narrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is\nthat. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time\nand there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not\nbounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at\nUniversity of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address\nand his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.\n\nSincerely,\nVictor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)\n\nP.S.

What \nwas he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't \nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \nthe government--why my husband was killed.\n\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\nHe doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we \nlived. I say, \"I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV.\" He looked \nagain and said, \"Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \nmany people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \nyou can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, \"Down with the \nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's \naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \ncan't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \nAnd my son says, \"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \ndidn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \nsimply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what's going on, what \nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what \nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \neach second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their \nheads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \ndon't know.\n\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \ndear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \nyou afraid of, they're just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \nVocational School. \"Don't fear,\" he said, \"it's nothing, nothing all that \nbad.\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \nWhen I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and \nthere and I said, \"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don't be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting\ndifferent things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \"You speak\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\" He says \"Close the window\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it's\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \nThings had calmed down slightly.\n\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \nget up.\" I say, \"Today's my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren't you going \nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \nyou going?\" He says, \"I'm going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \noutside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to\nme, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take \nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\n\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\nit was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I\nsaid, \"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\"\n\nTires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm \nstanding on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \nthey've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \no'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten\no'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \nI'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \ndon't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see \nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\n\"look what they're doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \ninside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in \nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, \nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They've killed\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without \nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \ngo to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my \ndaughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \nand went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \nhere, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, \nand I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \nUncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the \ngarage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \nEmma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for \nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \nI'm coming too.\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \nhere with us, I'm go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \nEmma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's \nthere . . . wheezing.\"\n\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don't go near him, \nor we'll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and \nsaid, \"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \nAlik, maybe he'll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\n\nI went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \nthere, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still \nlying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\nwindow until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\no'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don't\ngo out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\nalive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\"\n\nAt six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \nwanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They\nsaid, \"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\"\n\nIt's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\" Now Shagen \njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they've \nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \ndead . . . he's alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\" \nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway, \nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes \nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \nlike that there was no hope left.\n\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \npeople.\n\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa's been killed.\"\n\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \nyes, that's our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor's office\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We're taking care of all that,\ndon't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\nsays, \"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just\none second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\nlike a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\"\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli\nSadukhov.\n\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \nhospital until the 4th.\n\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let's go.\" And the women, our \ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They're going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\nstill can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let's \ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can't look, no.\"\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\" He says, \n\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\nbeen injured at work . . .\n\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \ndown, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \nwe've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\n\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform \nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \nget here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\"\n\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I'm \nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \narson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone \nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\nsays, \"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \nif it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\n\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you're \ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \n\"Yes.\" \"And now you're telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \nforgot!\" Like that.\n\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What's your nationality?\" He \nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he's an\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too \n. . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \nthat's where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\n\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\nwere taken. He says he didn't take them\n\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\nit, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \nhave the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\nI didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven't straightened \neverything out, I think that's unjust.\"\n\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\npercent of his body . . .\n\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \nArmy. And now they're fatherless...\n\nI couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\nyears' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years' \ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\ncreep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn't a \nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\n\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\" I \nstill don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\ndon't understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\nanswer . . . No one answered me . . .\n\n   May 19, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n* What are the US export regulations?\n* What is TEMPEST?\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n* Is RSA patented?\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\n\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\n\n  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\n\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\n\n* What are the US export regulations?\n\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\n\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\n  least heard of the ITAR.\n\n* What is TEMPEST?\n\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\n\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\n  is available this way.\n\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\n  corrections.)\n\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\n\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\n\n  The Beale Cypher Association\n  P.O. Box 975\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\n\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\n  line:\n\n  send index\n\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\n\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\n  string.\n\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\n\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\n\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\n\n* Is RSA patented?\n\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\n  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\n\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\n\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\n\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\n\n  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of\n  course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site.

I just said\n\"Don't ask me which ones.\"  I didn't say I don't know what that means.\n\nSuch hacking can be EASILY discouraged by adding anti-patching code which\ndoes a self-check upon execution and refuse to load if CRC does not match\nvalue stored (encrypted, of course) in the program.

The purpose of copy\nprotection is to discourage casual pirates (\"Oh, can I have a copy of\nthat?\"/\"Sure, here.\") and the less sophisticated pirates (\"Let's look for\nall those calls to INT13H...\") .  Any one determined enough to break copy\nprotection can and will succeed.  They can always backtrace the entire\nload-sequence of the program.  The point of copy protection is to make\nsuch attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses\n(or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use.  Pirates who see copy\nprotection as a challenge love breaking them, and no amount of copy\nprotection will stop them, but the rest of us WILL be stopped.

If he/she\ndoes not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher.\nSexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an\nenormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that\nthey are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not\ndiscuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel\ndepartment that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most\ncompanies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety\ndoes seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.\n\nIt is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is\nnot inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee\nproblems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do\nnotice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of\nhigher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the\nentire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with\nyou.

But to add to this\nexplaniation, each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe, just so\nthe detector does not read the background radiation(i.e. cosmic rays), \nif I remember right, the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the \nbackground.  This is so they don't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays\nthat would normally set it off. Even with this buffer, they still have to throw\nout something like 1/2 of the bursts that they DO get, because of the Earth's\nVan Allen Belts, the South Atlantic Anomaly, the Sun,  if I remember right,\nthere is either a radar station, or a radio station in Australia, and there are\na couple other sources as well.  \n                                                -jeremy\n                                                belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: lioness@maple.circa.ufl.edu\nSubject: Re: Kubota Kenai/Denali specs\nOrganization: Center for Instructional and Research Computing Activities\nLines: 21\nReply-To: LIONESS@ufcc.ufl.edu\nNNTP-Posting-Host: maple.circa.ufl.edu\n\nIn article <1993Apr28.151652.23080@dsd.es.com>, pmartz@dsd.es.com (Paul Martz) writes:\n|>Does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling, but not both\n|>simultaneously?\n\nI don't know the answer the to this one, although with 8-bits I would assume\nthat it was one or the other.\n\n|>\n|>> Stereo support\tyes\t\t\tyes\n|>> Other:\t\t\tboth machines will double buffer or do\n|>                                                                 ^^\n|>> \t\t\t\tstereo output per window.
