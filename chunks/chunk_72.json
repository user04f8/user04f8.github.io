EDT\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon \nto be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out \nthe first pitch.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not \nAmtrack.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's \ngoing from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to \nbreak the logjam with  ??? Senate?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are \ndiscussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, \nand I think that the President is going to continue to make the point \nthat he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs \nto be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for \nsummer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the \nimportant programs that will put people back to work right away this \nsummer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be \npassed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will he compromise, that's the question?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions \nare going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and \nSenator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President \nbelieves his jobs program should go forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 \nbillion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise \nbeing offered by --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being \noffered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right \nnow, let's see what happens today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would he go that far -- no matter what the \nRepublicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per \nyear?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his \nprogram should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be \nwilling to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to \ncome up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's \nsee what happens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has \nhappened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order \nto get a vote?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more \nintrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in \ndoing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the \nRepublicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the \nPresident's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, \nreal jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no \nquestion about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative \nactivity over the last few days.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package \nthrough?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the \nconversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     prepared to compromise --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen \nto what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting \nwith Senator Dole. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's \nbeen very successful so far in the beginning of his term.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record \ntime, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by \n$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for \nimportant investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong \npassage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a \nminority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock \nand hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that \nhe is not succeeding overall.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He can't beat this, can he?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The fact is they can do that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop \naction.  There's no question about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What are you going to do about it?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, what do you know about these alleged notes \ntaken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears \nthat the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that \nwhen they say yes they mean no?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete \nmisreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the \nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's \nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   Are you saying that the President said that when \nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the \nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \nthere appears to be --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the \nJapanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It \ndoes talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of \nview.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that \nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \nbut I'm not positive.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was the specific comment that was made \nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that \nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \"when the \nJapanese say yes they mean no.\"\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \nI don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was he saying it facetiously first?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \nobservation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President \nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \nI'm not sure exactly how many.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're \nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is \non.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's \ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \nhear that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \nfor the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. \npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary \nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \nSaddam can't stay in office?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our \njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \ncontinue to demand it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \ndominant power in the area --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \nsupport of terrorism.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in \npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \nbase that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \narmaments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \nwould be out of power?\n\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \ndo you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical \ndifference with you that's in good faith?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\n-\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true \nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \nhave an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in \nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \nimportant, and we're going to continue to fight for it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \nthrough?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \nand to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \nthe summer?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \nRepublicans into your camp?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to \nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \nPresident's intiatives?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \ncould get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  \nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and \nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \nPresident's going to continue to reach out when he can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You don't have any regrets then about the way you \nhave handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your \napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \nexperience?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue \nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \nthere's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with \nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  They're being denied any other legislative means of \nputting their proposals forward.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any ideas.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \ndefeated; I don't know that they're being denied.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     to present them.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean \nthey get the votes --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \nparliamentary rules under which they're playing.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \nsupport all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for \nIraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of \ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about \nanything recently.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \nPresident's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \nAngeles.  \n\t     \n\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \nwouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to \nwatch it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \nReverend Jackson while he's out there?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see \nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \nraised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, \neven though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \ngame?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe \nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \ninformational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to \nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \nPresident read it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \nPresident Gore.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \nyes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \nactivities?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would \nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \noperation at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the \nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \nnot pursuing some kind of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \nmention in the news conference yesterday --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your \nquestion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what \ndoes the U.S. do next?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \nallies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways \nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \nagreement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \nsaid there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any \ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \ndifferent.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the \nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to \ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \nthat is under consideration.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's \ncondition, how he's doing?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think \nwe'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \nafter the Mubarak visit.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with \nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \nnext several weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \nof the one announced Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the \nmagnitude.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \ndo you stand on that --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \nhe's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this \nweek and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a \nhard look at it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White \nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the \ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll \nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a \nprobability than a possibility?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under \ndiscussion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter \nof time and -- for months before that happens.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's \nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working \nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll \ncontinue to review other matters.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \nthis week?  Any travel?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \ndon't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right \nnow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference \nof Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National \nConference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  \nWe'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate \ndiscussions.\n\t     \n\t     Thanks.\n\n\n                                 ###\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: pyron@skndiv.dseg.ti.com (Dillon Pyron)\nSubject: Re: Ammo in a fire (was Re: WACO burning)\nLines: 52\nNntp-Posting-Host: skndiv.dseg.ti.com\nReply-To: pyron@skndiv.dseg.ti.com\nOrganization: TI/DSEG VAX Support\n\n\nIn article <C5xBwr.5B8@world.std.com>, htf@world.std.com (Harry Carter) writes:\n>sunshine@cco.caltech.edu (Tom Renner) writes:\n>\n>>v111qheg@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu (P.VASILION) writes:\n>\n>>>Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes?

He was\n    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in\n    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-\n    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife\tdied,\n    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even\n    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,\n    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss\n    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare\n    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such\n    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one\n    looked upon an angel.\n\n    Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-\n    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved\n    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her\n    gender.  When\tshe  once, early in March brought the first violet to\n    him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:\n\n    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-\n    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes\n    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in\n    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-\n    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be\n    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to\n    attract the public\teye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in\n    quietude and peace.\n\n    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the\n    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,\n    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which\twas  beaming  in  the\n    morning sun:\n\n    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem\n     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-\n    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:\n    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure\n    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the\n    hardest\n\n\t\t\t\t   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;\ttouch\n    it\tbut carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the\n    same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!\n    Then pointing to a rose he said:\n\n     Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More\n    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to\n    the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure\n    of\theart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the\n    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,\n    as\tshe  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.\n    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with\n    their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least\n    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and\twan,  and  go\n    before their time to the grave.\"\n\n\n\n\n    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one\n    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not\n    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle\n    of\tthe garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was\n    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it\n    blossomed  earlier\tthan  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The\n    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that\n    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at\n     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father\n    and said:\n\n    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling\n    of\tred  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of\n    flowers!\n\n    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes\n    once  more\tupon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the\n    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all\n    become  brown  and\tyellow\tand  when  the\tsun came forth in its\n    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter\n    tears at the sight. Then said the father:\n\n    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my\n    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced\n    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree\n    an\timage of what would happen if you were to wander from the way\n    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has\traised\tin  my\theart\n    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,\n    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed\n    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your\n    cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I\n    should\n\n\t\t\t\t   -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    go down sorrowfully to my grave.\n\n    As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,\n    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her\n    mind that she never forgot them.\n\n    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and\twise,  and  amid  the\n    flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-\n    gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring\tas  a\n    violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.\n\n    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the\n    fruits  of\this  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how\n    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect\n    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his\n    pious teaching and example.\n\n    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together\tin  a\n    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:\n\n    The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one\n    to\tthe  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-\n    dered still more lovely by being together. In  the\tsame  way  my\n    dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and\n    cannot be separated\n\n\n\n\n    The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought\n    of the presence of God\n\n-- \nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \nViva Cristo Rey !!

In other\n>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday\n>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.\n\nI think the passage you're looking for is the following.\n\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \nheaven. \nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \n\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\nimpose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\nin Acts 15.)\n\nHowever there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\nissue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\nassures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we\nlive in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.\n"}, {"text": "From: robert.desonia@hal9k.ann-arbor.mi.us (Robert Desonia) \nSubject: Re: PC Parallel I/O\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: HAL 9000 BBS, W-NET HQ, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA\nReply-To: robert.desonia@hal9k.ann-arbor.mi.us (Robert Desonia) \nLines: 24\n\n\nR >>>JD> ALL PC parallel ports that are compatable with the IBM standard,\nR >>>JD> including the original IBM adaptor, are bi-directional.\n\nNOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BI-DIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION.\n\nMy experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their \noriginal 286s proves that.
