Our agency started to express interest in\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\n\n\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\nper second).\n\n\n|> \n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\n|> companies,\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\n\n\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\ndata representations.\n\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\n\n\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\n\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

We are not\nsaved by what we do.  However,\n\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n(John 14:15).\n\nKeeping Christ's commandments is a \"work\" per se, and a demonstration of\nour love for him.  Also,\n\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\ndown.\n(Luke 13:6-9).\n\nAgain,\n\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n(John 15:16).\n\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\nin the actions that we carry out.\n\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. \nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\npants is more important.\n\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\ncommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \n\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\nprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for\ndays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a\nbuilding and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you\nall day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have\nthat faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the\ntest.  Words and talk mean nothing.\n\nI could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but\nthis should be sufficient.\n\nHope it helped.\n\nJon\n\n----------------\nsig file broken....\n\nplease try later...\n----------------\n"}, {"text": "From: nataraja@rtsg.mot.com (Kumaravel Natarajan)\nSubject: Dirty Diesels?\nNntp-Posting-Host: opal12\nOrganization: Motorola Inc., Cellular Infrastructure Group\nDistribution: na\nLines: 17\n\nI heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than\ngas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide,\nHydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n"}, {"text": "Subject: FORTRAN library for MS-Windows\nFrom: traversmorgan@swell.actrix.gen.nz (Guan Lye Chua)\nOrganization: Actrix Information Exchange\nLines: 13\n\n\nHi!

Over the last few\nyears I have heard of one case after another of government running\ncompletely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the\ngovernment's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I\nintend to put together what I call the \"American Horror File\": a\ncompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod\nover the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing\nespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,\nand financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,\nbut including any other cases for which I can find decent\ndocumentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,\nred-hot enraged at their government.\n\nThe end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text\nand postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent\nyears.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage\npeople to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and\nprint out copies and give them to neighbors.\n\nThis is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on\nhow government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer\ninformation that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific\ninstances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to\njoin me in collecting and researching information for this project.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKevin S.

At the moment the main fora\nfor such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither\nof which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the\ngeneral cdrom community with focuses on library, government and\nnetwork usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted \nto publishing (CDPub has just been setup).

Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, \nPhoto CD and other related formats would be included as well. \nTopics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly\nhardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and\nother legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in\nthe purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other\nnonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom\npublishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as\nindex and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom\nsimulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging\nsoftware, data capture software, data clean up, compression,\nencryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that\naids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and\nvideo.\n \nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that\nrelates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,\nsuch as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as\ninformation that publishers need to know about the hardware that\nthe intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will\neventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.\n \nNotes\n-----\nThese groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or\nquestions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or\nquestions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.\nRequests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general\ntopics should be directed to other fora.

What is important is HOW they are used, and what \n          else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )\n\n\n          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. \n               1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind \n          at a time, preferably grapes. \n               2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half \n          raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape \n          clean the intestinal linings. \n               3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice \n          you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune \n          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from \n          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to \n          your home bathroom.) \n               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and \n          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS \n          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). \n               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from \n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \n          Drink one glass per hour.\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \n          PULP.] \n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \n      \n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \n          cider \"flavored\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \n        \n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \n          (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \n          book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \n          prepare it and drain it.\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \n          other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \n          present at those times).\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \n       \n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \n       \n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \n               about 2 months. \n        \n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \n\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \n               day.\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \n\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \n               \"A.I.D.S.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to \n               leukemia.]  (See the book \"Life Extension\", by Durk \n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \n\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \n               several times per day.\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \n               described above. \n\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \n\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \n               magnetic fields. \n\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \n               as most other medical problems.

Anyone have any ideas ??  \n\nI expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network\nitself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have\nroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell\nfile servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our\nEthernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each\nsegment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run\nwere very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.\n\nBut the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486\n33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have\n10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns\nbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will\nattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time\nslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.\n\nHaving said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\nin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\nthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\nyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\nIt all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\nto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\ndoing network things also...)\n-- \n       Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels\n Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com\n  BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK\n   Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!\n"}, {"text": "From: ballb@carr113.alleg.edu (Brett Ball)\nSubject:  Re:NHL letter\nOrganization: Allegheny College\nLines: 2\n\nIf you wanted to send your own letter to the NHL where would you send it?\nBrett E.

I applied\nto about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to\nhear from the other school.\n\nLet me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical\nschool admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, \nbut they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some\nschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look\nat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund\non your $50 application fee.\n\nBut, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers\nand are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it\nan acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a\ndenial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How\ndid your interviews go?\n\nAs for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted\nme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was\nover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection\nletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are\nstill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become\nfixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.\n\nWhat do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very\nmediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software\nengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.

I think admissions committees are bound in\nmany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each\nperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.

But this is not the\nissue. The issue is that you were cheering DEATH. Read again your original\narticle. You find Israeli government responsible for those dead soldiers, that's\na reasonable (debatable) point, but feel satisfaction from dead bodies is \nNOT REASONABLE  by any standards. No matter how you try to justify it.\nI may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in S Lebanon.\nBut no matter what you say, I can not understand your satisfaction for dead\nbodies.\n\nI have a question for you. Let's assume a bosnian village, inhabited by serbs\nuntill a few (10-20) years ago, and later taken over by bosnian muslims (the means\nare not very peaceful). Now, do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all (armed)\nbosnian muslims ? I would not enjoy, but I would not enjoy ANY dead bodies - \nisraelis, lebanese or bosnians.\n\n\nDorin\n\n\n"}]}
