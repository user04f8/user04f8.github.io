But had\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\nI generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have\nany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\nto have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \nlegs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\nI'm frequently in severe pain.\n\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\n(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd \nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\n\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\nbut I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\na reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\nI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\nI've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\nI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\nthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?\nMy doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\npain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\nsuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.\n\nAnyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\n\nJanice Rathmann\n\n"}, {"text": "From: hildjj@jupiter.fuentez.COM (Joe Hildebrand)\nSubject: Re: question regarding overlaying of graphics\nOrganization: The Internet\nLines: 30\nTo: venkatg@grace.cs.orst.edu (Gopal Venkatraman)\nCc: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu\n\n\n> Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvas(see above) \n> one intersecting the other...\n> Now, I would like to delete one of the rectangles.\n> The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the\n> GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the\nnewly\n> created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.\n> A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection\nthe pixel \n> locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which\nis \n> something that should be avoided.\n\nYou could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.

There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and\nshareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself\nthought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace-\nment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will\neven change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan\ndoes that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do\nthat, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kinda\nhard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not\npaying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differet\nstory ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons\nnot correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :)..\nPM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager...

It uses freon jets for\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).

The Bible \"ends\"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No.\nSo who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer\nhappening or still happening ?\n\nI can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-)\nWith the cold response I've gotten from the past from this\ngroup, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only\ngo over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look\nat documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted\nbodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-)\nThe apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle\nspecifically granted to show God's existence. That was\nthe spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several\ncountries. That event is \"approved\" by the Pope. Currently,\nimages of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa\nare showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under\ninvestigation by the Church. But realize that investigations\ntake decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come\nin ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-).\nOther events under investigation are inner locutions (\"coming\nto know\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And\nthey don't heal. And doctor's don't know why).\nNon-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.\n\nThis stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M\nor God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're\nhappening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody\ncan figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion.\nIf you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned.\nThese are not \"members only\" events. God and Mary invites \neverybody.\n\nSo in conclusion (finally) ...\nWe RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary.\nWe are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to.\nThere are more proofs and events. And that is why \"not everything\nis in the Bible\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told\nto read the Bible.\n\nAs far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned...\nIn the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how.\nI have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry\nabout the \"versus\" part. Just do God's work. That's all\nthat matters. Unity will come.\n\nBTW, I'm just a plain person.

Our  \nthree year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  \nthat appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.\n\n\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\n\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.

It\nBM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities\n\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nhenrik]\tAgain, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do\nhenrik]\twant them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.\n\nNews reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.  \nCAPS don't change facts.\n\nBM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,\nBM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it\nBM] is a part of it.  \n\nhenrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged \nhenrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.\n\nSo?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about \nDEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.\n\nhenrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \nhenrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the \nhenrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending \nhenrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. \n\nBM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them\nBM]  within their borders?  \n\nhenrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into \nhenrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.\n\nSo I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?\n\nhenrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the \nhenrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER \nhenrik] OCCUR again.\n\nBM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?\n\nhenrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped\nhenrik] into Armenia if SHE could.\n\nWhy would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash\nthat Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,\nlike economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd\nbe happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET\nrather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't \ndo.  \n\nBM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header\nBM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  \n\nhenrik]\t   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many\nhenrik]\t   cases, HISTORY repeats itself. \n\nEven if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would\nbe to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been\na democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the\ntime, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no\nwish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not\nonly accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]\n\nBM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes \nBM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring\nBM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians \nBM] are attacking Azeri towns.\n\nhenrik]\t   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey\nhenrik]\t   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!\n\nSo what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  \n\nhenrik]\t   I will believe it when I see it.\n\nNo, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.\n\nhenrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\nhenrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\n\t\nThis kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.\n\nhenrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\nhenrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\nhenrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !\n\nNow, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff\nperpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to\nkeep the hatred alive, right?\n\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \nBM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \n\nhenrik]\t   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \nhenrik]\t   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \nhenrik]\t   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \n\nWell they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods\nof asking (not very peaceful I'd say).\n\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\n\nhenrik]\t   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\nhenrik]\t   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\nhenrik]\t   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\n\nI don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.\nPeace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening\nright now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights \nraving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure\nthere'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other\nside.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace\nthan they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't\nstrong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the \nbombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign \nrelations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided\natrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to \nthe other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,\nthis being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.\n\n\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \nBM] their blood and future. \n\nhenrik]\t   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\nhenrik]\t   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\nhenrik]\t   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\n\nAzeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support\nwhat they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be\nreached in this manner.  \n\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.\n\nhenrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely\nhenrik]   for it. \n\nIt didn't look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me \nthat if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also\ntalk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair?\n\nhenrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,\nhenrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of\nhenrik] The Armenian Massacres.\n\nYou don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.'\nYes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were.\nLet's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our\nkids will also be hateful.

As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law\nhas made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does\nnot follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out,\nbrain death is not a means of determining who has the rights\nof the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant\ndifference.\n\nWhat I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that\nyou feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the\nthread you started?  You got answers to your questions when\nyou began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some\nridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,\nchanged the subject with your remarks about having a discussion\nof substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,\nwhy then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss\nsilly accussations, e.g. \"It really doesn't matter to you...\"\nIf it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek\nsome substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person\nof the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic\nand show some meaning to your words.\n\n> >> >>         2) If she is, then why does the mother have the right to kill\n> >> >>            her when she is in the womb but not after she has passed\n> >> >>            through the birth canal?\n> >> \n> >> >Because a woman has a right to have any object which threatens her\n> >> >health and is within the confines of her body removed.

Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.\nA woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore\nmy statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would\nnot be granted a born human being.

Try this on\nfor size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill\nthe other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.\nBut the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the\nother in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The\nsystems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling\nto see anything analagous here and failing to do so.\n\n> >> Of course, the situation is NOT a perfect comparison; it may well be that\n> >> one siamese twin deliberately initiates oppression or coersion against\n> >> the other.

Your comparison is a total\nfailure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in\nreality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert\nthat it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,\nthat of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,\nyou give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one\nhand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than\na hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins\nmurdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each\nother in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe\nin now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions\nare made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where\nthey cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,\nthere is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim\nthat is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a\nclaim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to\nits claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?\n\n> >> >>         3) If a parent has the right to choose to not take responsibility\n> >> >>            for their own child, why are there laws and penalties against\n> >> >>            child abandonment?\n> >> >This last question is irrelevant and something of a non sequitur.\n> >> >Can you establish some relevance or even some sense for it?\n> >> If at some point an unborn child is a human being, the parents clearly\n> >> have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward\n> >> their children.\n> >Again, what is the relevance?

What\nis different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this\nout for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one\ncase you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born\nchild (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus\ncan), and in this case you recognize a significant difference\nbetween the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at\nstake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are\nirrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction\nanyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have\nborne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a\nhealthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as\nshe chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at\nparties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and\nthe provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary\nthan the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\n\nDean Kaflowitz\n\n"}, {"text": "From: tedebear@leland.Stanford.EDU (Theodore Chen)\nSubject: Re: Ultimate AWD vehicles\nOrganization: DSG, Stanford University, CA 94305, USA\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 7\n\nIn article <Apr16.215151.28035@engr.washington.edu> eliot@stalfos.engr.washington.edu (eliot) writes:\n>the price of parts is a different story though...\n\nyou can say that again.\nhow does $23 for a new thermostat sound?\n\n-teddy\n"}, {"text": "From: Scott.Marks@launchpad.unc.edu (Scott Marks)\nSubject: Re: NHL Team Captains\nNntp-Posting-Host: lambada.oit.unc.edu\nOrganization: University of North Carolina Extended Bulletin Board Service\nLines: 18\n\n>And of course, Mike Ramsey was (at one time) the captain in Buffalo prior to\n>being traded to Pittsburgh.

On a couple of occasions on\nthose shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he\nmade the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in\ndispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled\nand occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying\nthat since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and\nlost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to\nreconquer them today.\n\nI was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew\nwho escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found\nsympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent\nmonths when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my\nfather would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi\nand pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is\nso pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My\nfather also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,\nbecause, my father said, Anthony Lewis \"is always talking about\nthe Muslims.\"\n\nUpdate--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around\nSbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and\nthe killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton\nadministration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the\ncollapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.\nPreviously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds\nthat it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces\nbegan to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers\nwent unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention\nto stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The\ncurrent disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West\nand a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to\nhalt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that\nLord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly\ncalls for strong action.\n\nCLINTON AND BOSNIA\n\nIn the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department\nofficial, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made\nnews when he resigned from the State Department because of the\nBush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian\naggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to\nthe president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by\ngetting involved there.\n\nApparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.\nClinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did\nabout the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has\nso far been the same.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton\nadministration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March\nreport by its own experts which called for military action if\nnecessary to protect \"safe havens\" for the Muslims. At one point,\nSenate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the\nreport was kept from Congress, that he called for an\ninvestigation.\n\nInstead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled\nagain and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what\nthey want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been\nsignalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish\noff the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other\nway.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would\nNOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this\nissue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could\nnot have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better\nwell before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and\nthe destruction might have been curtailed..\n\nThe Nation, the left and \"the Bosnian QUANDARY\"\n\nTypical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core\nissue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying\nhundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the \"Bosnian\nquandary\" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes\nto do nothing, even while noticing \"the ghastly atrocities of the\nBosnian Serbs\"  and that the \"greater and lesser powers...dither\nand fuss [and] hang back.\" (\"Before anything else happens, the\nClinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United\nStates owes the\" U.N. the editorial concludes.)\n\nIn its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that\n\"those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side\nof the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World\nWar II.\"  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the\nBosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients\nincluding the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and\nothers. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher\nHitchens correctly called this editorial, \"contemptible.\")\n\n***\n\nWilliam Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The\nNew Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal\ncolumnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly\nand consistently called for strong Western and American\nintervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column\n(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled \"International\nCowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy.\"\n\nHe clarifies the international failure which has led to present\nsituation in one sentence. \"Having refused to intervene to\nsanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent\nCroatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military\naggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious\n\"ethnic cleansing\" which followed that, the United Nations now\ncontemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which\ntwo years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since\nexperienced.\"  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged\ncall for a \"more daunting and open-ended military assignment than\na direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have\nbeen a year ago.\"\n\nAryeh Neier on the Serbs In his \"Watching Rights\" column in the\nThe Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the\nmotivation of the \"aggressors\"--the preferred term for the Serbian\nforces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than\na year.  He explains that \"there is no  military purpose that is\nserved by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above\nall, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would\nwant to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are\nnot city people.\n\n\"It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of\nBosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at\nany price--that explains the conduct of the siege of\nSarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and\ncosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.\n\n\"Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil\nservants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,\nmade up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The\ndestruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility\nagainst this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The\ndemagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war\nexploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred\nfor all that is cosmopolitan.\"\n\nThe light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is\nat stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,\nfundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,\ncosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking\nthe rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the\nbeginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained\nby the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a\nthreat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.\n\nNeier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to\nsecularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's the\nSerbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic\nidea.\n\nAnthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does\nrespect for Clinton's presidency \"depend...on his acting\neffectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to\ndo nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values\nwe and our allies profess.\"  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely\na betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us\nby proxy, just as Hitler was.\n\nOne argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a\ndifferent form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for\nEurope.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians;\nthat is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been\nthe key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the\nhundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities\nresult in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.\n\nOne of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though\nthe Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to\nthe destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will\ninevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a\nwhirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.\nAnd as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we\ndo so decisively, quickly and on our terms.\n\nSincerely, Ronald Bleier\n\n"}, {"text": "From: suwanto@iastate.edu (zapper)\nSubject: Re: 2SC1096, 2SA634 specs?\nOrganization: Iowa State University, Ames IA\nLines: 35\n\n>Could some kind soul post me the max power/voltage/current ratings of\n>2SC1096 and 2SA634 transistors, their conductance types and pinouts.\n>They are used in the sweep portion of a TV set.\n\n2SC1096\n  Maximum Ratings:\n    VCBO = 40V\n    VCEO = 30V\n    IC   = 3A\n    PC   = 10W (T=25C)\n\n  ICBO max = 1uA\n  VCB = 30V\n  COB = 55pF\n\n  at Q-point VCE=5, IC=1A --> hfe = 100\n\n2SA634\n  Maximum Ratings:\n    VCBO = -40V\n    VCEO = -30V\n    IC   = -3A\n    PC   = 10W (T=25C)\n\n  ICBO max = -1uA\n  VCB = -30V\n  COB = 75pF\n\n  at Q-point VCE = -5V, IC = -1A --> hfe = 100\n\nThat's all i can get from my data book, hope that helps.\n\nsuwanto@iastate.edu\n\n    \n"}, {"text": "From: mzimmers@netcom.com (Michael Zimmers)\nSubject: Re: Time of Game\nOrganization: Netcom Online Communications Services (408-241-9760 login: guest)\nLines: 22\n\nIn article <1993Apr21.024643.5135@adobe.com> snichols@adobe.com (Sherri Nichols) writes:\n\n>The reason I'm unhappy with the length of games today is summed up above.\n>For an extra 15 minutes/game (average) in the AL, and an extra 11 minutes\n>(average) in the NL, I'm seeing fewer runs score. \n>\n>Now, what I think I *am* seeing is more pitches.

Let us say a little\nThe ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are\ndisciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different\ncongregations were always competing and arguing about which one was\nbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything\ninto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've\nfound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they\nare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in\nJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this\nretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even\nthe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple\nthe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\nunified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along\ntogether.\n\n>The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches\n>(denominations) with the same characteristics.

Or is this definitely an untolerable situation\n>  according to the Scriptures?\n\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\nshow which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\n\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\n   fellowship\n   communion\n   filling with awe for God\n   all having everything in common.\n   glad and sincere hearts\n   praising God\n   enjoying the favor of the people\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\n7:54-60).  \n\n>- can one say that only one of these three churches is the\n>  true church of Jesus Christ?\n\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is\ntotally sold out to God.\n\n>\n>A problem closely related to these question is:\n>- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - \n>  before there is a unity? This question is especially important\n>  for those who think that only one church can be the \"true one\".\n>\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\nI know I haven't.\n\n>Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you.\n>For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which\n>are founded by people of one specific church and whose members\n>are all members of that church.

A clique is a group which\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\nsomething \"correct\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\nwould've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\nwithin.  There's enough division without.\n\n>Thanks for your opinions in advance!\n>\n>Maarten\n\nJoe Fisher\n"}, {"text": "From: sra@idx.com\nSubject: Help w/ Greenleaf CommLib 4.0?\nOrganization: IDX Corporation, S.
