This proposal to establish a secret government designed\ncryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice\nencryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their \nsecrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret \nis patently unAmerican.

The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment \nis avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press \nrelease will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizen\nmay gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the \ngovernment escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number\nwhich is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an \nobvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott \nunderstand my objection to key registration, consider the way J.

We know that early Christians\nsuffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:\n\nACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them.

Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of\n            Jesus, and let them go.\n\nACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been\n            counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.\n\nIt appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion\nto even hearing Jesus's name.\nACT 5:28    \"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\" he said.\n            \"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are\n            determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\"\n\nFinally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly\nnot by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen. \n\n\n>The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different\n>forms in the religions of antiquity.

The reasons are pragmatic: even if\n>Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\n>Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\n>clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although\n\nI am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been \nborn from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, \nyet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself \na Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature,\nnot a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying\nwith the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by \nWesterners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: \n\n\"If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the\nnations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have\nopposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. \nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \"to worship in their own\nway\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\ncountries.\"[1]\n\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\nRomanian nation today\" (Popescu Ciocanel).\n\n\"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\nadvanced European countries.\"[2]\n\n\"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\nhappy!\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\n\n\"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection.\"\n\n\"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \npriests.\" (A.

Since we apparently\ndon't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing\ncameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests\nare going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the\nvideo being piped into a command center they're building\nsomewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or\ncheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large\nmulti-colored status displays will show the various routes\nusing different colors to represent the various average speeds\nfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front\nof the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic\nstatus to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also\nlooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to\nproviding continuous audio from this system.\n\nIn the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display\nboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data\non traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the\nsystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it\nwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\n\"cheap\").\n\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\nreceivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\ndon't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.

But I just wasn't\n ready for what happened this particular Monday.\"\n\n    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the\n Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local\n law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew\n the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak\n afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.\n\n    \"'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me.\n 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house,\n kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't\n believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare.\"\n\n    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting\n on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty\n agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up\n with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to\n search for a \"Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial\n number.\"  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also\n authorized agents to seize \"any tools used in the alteration or\n modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers,\n books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants\n or owners of the property to be searched....\"\n\n    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force\n operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital\n involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against\n Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons\n drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the\n front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw\n personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the\n floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins;\n stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table\n in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not\n latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.\n\n    \"My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted\n through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and\n stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns,\n the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my\n magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking\n around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to\n turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down.\n Then I found the note.  \"Nothing Found - ATF.\"\n\n    \"They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa\n all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they\n can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then\n come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to\n watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain\n what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide\n open and left.\"\n\n    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  \"I asked,\n 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, \"Who is\n going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, \"If you're going\n to talk to me, come down to my office.'\n\n    \"'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had\n been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have\n lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms\n owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn\n around.\"\n\n    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, \"If you want your door to\n lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it\n yourself.\"\n\n    \"'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come\n down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring\n your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'\"\n\n\nSo if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, make\nsure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.\n\n\n> It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going\n> to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up\n> with a charismatic nutcase.\n\nWhat a repulsive outlook on society.  \"Followers of unusual religions\nmay be killed by the government -- it simply can't be helped in a free\nsociety.\"\n\nYou and I have two different concepts of \"free.\"\n-- \n\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet...\n"}, {"text": "From: cracker@tc.fluke.COM (Don Graham)\nSubject: Re: JEEP WRANGLER - OPINI\nOrganization: John Fluke Mfg.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\n\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\n\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\n\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\nindex is near the optimal level.\n\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\n\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\n\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC\n\n1.

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

Like I said before, \nI can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy \nceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  In fact, all \nfour gospels record the first \"breaking of the bread\" in some detail.  \nCommunion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my \nopinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of \nthe Body of Christ.  The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal \nmeals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during \ncommunion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact \nhiding shameful things from the general public.  In fact, I think if you read \nsome of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all \nbashful about describing what went on during communion.  That's why it seems \nfunny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st \ncentury Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they \nare \"too sacred.\"\n\n- Mark\n\n[Actually, that's not quite the case.  John omits the central elements\nof the Last Supper.  His Gospel is full of symbolism of bread and\nwine.  But the actual story isn't there.  Some people think he has\nomitted some of the details because they were not talked about in\npublic in his community.  There is also evidence that some aspects of\nbaptismal practice were kept secret. See Morton Smith's \"Secret\nGospel\" -- I don't agree with his lurid speculations on what the\nsecret practices actually were, but there does seem to be some\nevidence that Mark omitted certain details because they were \ninappropriate for publication.  --clh]\n"}]}
