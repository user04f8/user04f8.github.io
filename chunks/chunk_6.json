Buehler)\nSubject: Re: SSPX schism ?\nOrganization: none\nLines: 182\n\nHere is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in\ngeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\n\nJoe Buehler\n\n...\n\nSchism and Disobedience\n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\n\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\nheresy.\"\n\n...\n\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\n\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\nresponse.\n\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\nagainst the unity of the Church.\n\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\n\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\n\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\nparallel Church.\n\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\nimagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:\n\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\n\n....\n\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\n\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:\n\n    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June\n    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also\n    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist \"obstinancies.\" And from the\n    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to\n    present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense\n    against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has \"an\n    erroneous concept of Tradition.\" If this were so, Cardinal\n    Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the\n    Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987:\n    \"Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it\n    'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to\n    the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern\n    and shares it.\"\n"}, {"text": "From: vrr@cbnewsj.cb.att.com (veenu.r.rashid)\nSubject: For sale:  760 meg ESDI drive, and 2 meg 256x4 DRAM\nOrganization: AT&T\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 19\n\n\nFOR SALE:\n\n\t1 ST4766E Seagate ESDI drive.  760 meg\t\t$500\n\t  unformatted.

That's especially true for\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\n\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\nthe subkeys even more.\n\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\nmake sure they stop''.\n\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\nthe warrant.\n\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\nlong.\n\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\nwithout the back door.\n\nThe cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no valid\nreasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- there\nare a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.\n"}, {"text": "From: mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca (Malcolm Lee)\nSubject: Re: A KIND and LOVING God!!\nOrganization: Royal Roads Military College, Victoria, B.C.\nLines: 35\n\n\nIn article <1993Apr22.203851.3081@nntpd2.cxo.dec.com>, bittrolff@evans.enet.dec.com () writes:\n|> \n|> In article <1993Apr20.143754.643@ra.royalroads.ca>, mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca (Malcolm Lee) writes:\n|> \n|> |>BTW, David Koresh was NOT\n|> |>Jesus Christ as he claimed.\n|> \n|> How can you tell for sure?

Your assistance is requested to \nidentify potential applications of remote sensing images and data.  We would \nlike your ideas for potential application areas to assist with development of\nthe Implementation Plan.\n \nPLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  \n \nWe are seeking your ideas in these areas: \n \n  (1)  Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images; \n \n  (2)  Potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in \n       education (especially levels K-12) and other noncommercial areas;\n \n  (3)  Types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data more \n       accessible;\n \n  (4)  Additional points of contacts for ideas; and \n \n  (5)  Addresses and names  from whom to request proposals. \n \nFor your convenience, a standard format for responses is included below.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\nguaranteed to be mapped.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\nis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \"tickle\" the\nWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable\nit to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\n\nWhat is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?\n"}, {"text": "From: gballent@hudson.UVic.CA (Greg  Ballentine)\nSubject: Re: plus minus stat\nNntp-Posting-Host: hudson.uvic.ca\nReply-To: gballent@hudson.UVic.CA\nOrganization: University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada\nLines: 23\n\n\nIn article 9088@blue.cis.pitt.edu, jrmst8+@pitt.edu (Joseph R Mcdonald) writes:\n\n>Jagr has a higher +/-, but Francis has had more points.

I have no particular plan (except to do\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\n\nI've had some more thoughts on my definitions:\n\nI've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\nfrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the\nspectrum over time.\n\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\ntime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\nFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\nurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\". I think I need some\nmore time with this one.\n\nThat's about it for now!\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:\n\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\nAs they swam its clearness through.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: dbernard@clesun.Central.Sun.COM (Dave Bernard)\nSubject: Re: Impeach Clinton, Reno\nReply-To: dbernard@clesun.Central.Sun.COM\nOrganization: Sun Microsystems\nLines: 22\nNNTP-Posting-Host: clesun.central.sun.com\n\n\n >   I HEARTILY agree.

The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\n    panning for each voice\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\n    access to all eight voices\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \n    modulation sources and routings.\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\n    the SQ-80.\n\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\n\n>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\nto use so I have avoided it.\n\nREASON FOR SALE:\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\n\nPRICING AND TERMS:\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept\n$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of \npatches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the \noriginal Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.\n\nPrice:    Asking $650.00 (everything)\nShipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCraig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems\ne-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Street\nphone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: lfoard@hopper.Virginia.EDU (Lawrence C.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the \nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \nsites?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three \nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\n\t     \n\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \nthey have troops on the ground there.\n\t     \n\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \nthink we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a \npolicy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can I follow up?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \nto stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.\n\t     \n\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making \nprogress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and \nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \nthe region.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the \nsituation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I \ndon't know that the administration could have made it different.\n\t     \n\t     On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the \nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies \nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \nin only a decade.  \n\t     \n\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \nThat's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \nare moving in the right direction economically.\n\t     \n\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \ndidn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \nThere are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I \njust disagree with that.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been \nunderway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \nargument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates \nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \nforward.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just \nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \nbasically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days \nwith regard to the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Waco --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have \nmuch to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \ninsights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole \nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry \nthat they killed their children.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \nPerot said today that you're playing games with the American people \nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \npackage.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign \nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \nresubmit them to the Hill?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \nWe're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going \nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \nthat rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. \nPerot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a \nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \n\t     \n\t     So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if \nmaybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and \nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \npolitical criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you \nthink you can sit back and just --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's \nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's \ngot some constructive ideas.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the American people have shown that they're very \nimpatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one \nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \neven if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my \njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will \nchange people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \ndebate and not just to the President.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \nunilaterally?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \nmandate of the United Nations.\n\n\t     Q\t  But you have a mandate and --\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \nthat we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for \naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \nWe are not.  \n\n\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \nwe have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French \nand others about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would that be military action?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in \nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \ngrip?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's \nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \nthese are things you said that you didn't support.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we \nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \nqualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \ndon't know exactly what he said.\n\t     \n\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss \nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going \nto do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies \nspeaking out of school.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's \na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had \na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a \nline against an administration policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I \ndon't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \nBut I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies \nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \nwhen you tell people they can't do certain things in this country \nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\n\t     \n\t     And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been \nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \nof their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \non this issue?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \nof emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \nand in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to \nsee it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my \ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \nand that's what I'll continue to do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \nBosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on \nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \nyour decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on \nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \ndecision?  \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There \nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \nrequired to embark on any new policy.\n\t     \n\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \nwar.  \n\t     \n\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\n\t     \n\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't \ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \nwe couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \nthese wars?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument \nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  \nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \nof ethnic tensions exist.\n\n\t     Q\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \nYeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the \nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \n\n\t     Q\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more \ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \nhandle that situation differently now?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that \nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come \nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to \nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \nhave asked.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \nSessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \nhis future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing \nbefore you do decide?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \nI'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \nto do with the direction of the FBI.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \ntake a partisan view in this war?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \nbe successful.\n\t     \n\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \nlooking at what else we can do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \nAren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \nGermany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've \ngot all of our options under review.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \nmilitary operation?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  \nThat's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \nde facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  \nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \npower.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're \ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \n\t     \n\t     I do believe that there's every reason to think that \nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail \nthere.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of \nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\n\t     \n\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \nrefinance their debt.  \n\t     \n\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \ntough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  \nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the \ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \nof this country.  \n\t     \n\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \nmillions of Americans.  \n\t     \n\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \nSo I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  \nI feel good about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that \none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \npractically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own \ncountry, how can we do it for them?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \nIt's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be \nfair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \nbe tied by many members of Congress.\n\n\t     Q\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \nThe Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and \nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \npursued.  \n\n\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \nwill do that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \n\n\t     Q\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \norder to then build support for Russian aid?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \ntoward reform.\n\t     \n\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \neconomy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And \nin a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all \nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \nbecause they haven't produced the results that the people so \nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \n\t     \n\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \nthat's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \nthink that we should support that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready \nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \nagreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental \nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \n\t     \n\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \nposition, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty \nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an \nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \nviolating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an \napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out \nthe details of that.\n\t     \n\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only \nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \nregion, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot \nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \nknow, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for \nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong \nabout the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not \nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \ndetails needed to be improved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\n\t     \n\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \nevaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \nthink that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \ninterchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know \nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't \nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I \nwas encouraged by the last trip.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \nus to confirm good faith?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases \nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \nthose cases.  And we're not there yet.  \n\t     \n\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \nvery influenced by how the families feel.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \nDole?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \n\t     \n\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \nPresident, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all \nstrung out and we're divided.\"  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \nhundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could \nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \nBut the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and redo --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \nwe need more police officers on the street.  \n\t     \n\t     That's another thing that -- I really believe that once \nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \nstreet who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's \nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \nright to know the names of the senior officers?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \nan Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I \nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \nmight be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think \nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I \nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \n\t     \n\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \ncon.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing \nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \nforces, sir?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \ninto a ground war there?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our \nevaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never \nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \nparticipating in some of the activities? \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't \nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \nbe done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of \nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \nAnd that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \nbe here, but for others as well.  \n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.\n\n                                 END1:48 P.M.

Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\nno ascension either.\n\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \n    \n\n> \n> Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body.

Can anybody help me out?\n\nThe problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\n\n>In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says \"For information\n>on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...\", this is so you\n>know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

For\n>example, the translation:\n>\tShift<Key>q:\tquit()\n>will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as\n>the Shift key (and the q key).\n\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?\n\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it's not possible.  That's according to\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\n\n>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you\n>can't use XtInstallAccelerators().\n\nI can't think of a reason why not.\n\n>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of\n>case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one\n>menu entry.\n\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\n\nFor example,\n\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\n\t\t\t\t\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  - exitPushbutton\n\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\n\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\n\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\nused TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\ndescribed above should work.\n\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)\n"}, {"text": "From: hou@siemens.com.

But that only for insurance ... and you\ncan't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they\nwill not offer.  And remember that the actual health care is delivered\nby private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.\nAgain, they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.\n\nPlus, there is the matter of culture and values ... I'm basically\nanti-tax and anti-government, by Canadian standards ... yet I can't\nbring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that I\nunderstand where you're coming from.

And if you do get\nthe training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a\nlicence because there is already someone in the business and who\ncannot fill his/her appointment book.

The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes\nby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations\nand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have\nthe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\n\nRemember, the Germans don't have HMO's ... a telling sign, 'cos\nRochester does and they're also a company town.\n\n>But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said\n>Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs, which require\n>spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches.

As someone who has SIMMS \nhe can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly\ngood idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?  \nAre they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used one\nif they are no longer made?

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.

Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.

Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet.

This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B.

There\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\nas salary.\n\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\n\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\n\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\nget supported, and how much.  \n\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\nwhich solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \n\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.\n-- \nHerman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399\nPhone: (317)494-6054\nhrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  \n{purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)\n"}, {"text": "From: Arthur_Noguerola@vos.stratus.com\nSubject: HEAVY METAL (the magazine) for sale (NOT the MUSIC)\nOrganization: Stratus Computer Inc, Marlboro MA\nLines: 19\nNNTP-Posting-Host: m21.eng.stratus.com\n\n          I  am  cleaning  out  the coffers.
