The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

As Vesselin\npoints out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be\nagain depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have guns\nand \"law abiding\" citizens don't, and criminals like me have marijuana\nand \"law abiding\" subjects don't, criminals like me will have secure\ncrypto while \"law abiding\" robots don't.  PGP is nice, but as time goes\non we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will.\n\nSomeone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He's my favorite dude.\n500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain\nthat to \"princes\" who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted\n(I've got \"The Prince\" at home, so I'll just paraphrase :) ) had to do\nwith conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy*\nit.  Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept\nthe people's customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression, a people\nwill remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive\ngovernment.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before*\nThomas Jefferson.\n\nThere were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* traffic\nis watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords\nlike marijauana, cryptography, NSA;  certain individuals who are known\nsubversives, etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So if\nyou know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it's pretty easy\nto go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and the\nless you're noticed, the better your chances of developing an organization\nwhich can diseminate truth to the masses.\n\nWhich gets me to the thread about a \"public encrypted conference\".\nThat's just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in an\ninfiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you're doing.  It will be\nfun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it's\npretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where\nyou get your marijuana.\n\nGuns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in\ngovernment who want you to *obey* their rules.  As Lundquist says in\nalt.drugs \"Live free or don't\".  Machiavelli pointed out that's just\nhow most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary.\nIt's true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as\nIntergraph's!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the\nU.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots\ncalled bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one might\nthink.  Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will be\nhurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom.\nde Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the\nmajority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.\n\nAnd given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne\nNational Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.\n\nPatience, persistence, truth,\t\twork: dvader@hemp-imi.hep.anl.gov\nDr. mike\t\t\t\thome: mrosing@igc.org\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQBVAgUBK9hETK3mm/E84rLHAQFV+gH9ExvzfXbNR4x0BTg2nQIxB5/ZMaxT289B\nG4QjTsv8mszMrzU1DcJ8eLIQ37BwX53jATBH9U4B/biqmGKiPzHCmA==\n=S3hf\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}, {"text": "From: buddha@iastate.edu (Scott H Vann)\nSubject: The bad press Islam has recieved.\nOrganization: Iowa State University, Ames IA\nLines: 16\n\n\n\tI recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic\n  person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media.\n  When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played\n  up as an Islamic Terrorist.

Both spacecraft will team up with\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\n     Japan's VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\nwhile within view on Earth.\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL's project manager for the\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\n     \"One of our main activities is developing the methodology\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\ncelestial objects,\" said Smith.\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\n     \"There is a long history of radio astronomy using\nground-based telescopes,\" said Smith. \"What we intend to do is to\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy.\"\n     Smith noted that if one examines \"the active galactic\nnuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\nthan you would expect.\"\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\nthe jets. Smith hopes that \"by using Space VLBI to look further\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.\"\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country's\nparticipation in the project.\n     \"Nothing is ever smooth,\" he said, \"but the Russians have\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.\"\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\nscience mission.\n     \"The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,\"\nhe said.\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\nambitious project, JPL's Smith is satisfied that planning for the\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\n     \"Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\nother.

Or is this\n  another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a Greater Truth?\n\n# The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\n# Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\n# strip and seek work in Israel.\n\n  Hey!  You forgot that Israel has also denied Syrians the same\n  'right'.  Come to think of it, Mexico is denying me that 'right'\n  evan as I write this!  Or are you ever so gently suggesting that\n  Israel, unlike every other country on Earth, shouldn't be allowed\n  to control traffic across its borders?\n\n# While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\n# Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\n# the Gazan resistance.  The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\n# Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\n\n  This sounds like a parallel, but it isn't.  Tell us how many Poles\n  went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment\n  there I forgot that in Poland, 'humanitarian assistance\" could\n  get you killed.  Come to think of it, humanitarian assistance to\n  the Gazans can get Israelis killed, too.  Except that in Gaza,\n  it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office.\n\n  So let's keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers aren't the\n  same, we'll need a proportionality value.  Should we use:\n    * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?\n    * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?\n    * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?\n    * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'?\n    * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?\n  Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn't matter\n  which we pick, they'll all be about the same, right?\n\n------------\n\nContrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill\noff the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to.\n(No, I'm not exaggerating.  And I really don't want to discuss how.)\nNote that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline\nspace than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once\nexterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines.\n\nSo if a \"Final Solution\" for Gaza would be so much better from\na *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it?

I would appreciate any comments about this and other\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\n\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\nout in 'noisy' situations.\n\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\n\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\noff a cliff).\n\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations. \n\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\nUSA\n"}, {"text": "From: matt@centerline.com (Matt Landau)\nSubject: Looking for updated XView textedit source (w/d-n-d support)\nArticle-I.D.: armory.1ri2o2$3hm\nOrganization: CenterLine Software, Inc.\nLines: 28\nNNTP-Posting-Host: 140.239.1.32\n\nThe XView version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section \nof X11R5 included the source to the textedit program.

After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see\nthe drive there's a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\na letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat's the moral of this story?

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\nRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \nam wrong.  \n\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\nyear is stealing bases.\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,\nor anythingelse wrong with him.

I\nguess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this\nchurch.  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor.  I also\nunderstand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately,\nthis is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is\nperceived to approach.\n\nThere is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any\ncost' style of theology.  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits into\nthis equation?\n\nBaptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springs\ntold they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious\nrite.\n\nBy Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau\n\nColorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured to\na church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a\nBaptist minister.\n\nDoxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by\ntheir parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the\nCornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight,\nfree balloons, squirt guns and candy.\n\nBefore that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked\ninto a room for religious instruction and told they should be\nbaptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or their\nfamilies are not of the Baptist faith.\n\nThe baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including\nPaulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls\nwho were baptized without her knowledge or consent.\n\n'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's a\nfalse pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the minister\ntold them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not\nbaptized.\n\nCornerstone church officials defended their actions.\n\n'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded\nus to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Bible\nwhere it says that parental permission is required before a child is\nbaptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist\nChurch.\n\nChurch officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized\nbecause 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.\n\nMany other parents also felt they were simply sending their children\nto a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were\nmembers of the Cornerstone Church.\n\nPolice said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the\nchildren, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nAren't these the same behaviors we condemn\nin the Hari Krishnas and other cults?\n\n[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account\nmentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is\nabsolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because of\nthe clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insisted\non being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willing\nto do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrant\nmuch careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so much\nparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether you\nbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign\nof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from\n*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of\nthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is\nlikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from\na baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he\nwould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already\nhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he get\nrebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's being\nrobbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.\n\n--clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: rschnapp@metaflow.com (Russ Schnapp)\nSubject: Re: Once tapped, your code is no good any more.\nNntp-Posting-Host: habu\nOrganization: Metaflow Technologies Inc.\nLines: 19\n\nIt might be nice to:\n\n1. cut out the ad hominem attacks on Prof. Denning, Mr. Sternlight,\netc.  If you have something objective to say about their views, go\nahead and say it (subject to point 2.).

They told\nme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''\n\n72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:\n\n- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.\n  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are\n  Turks, you must die.''\n\n28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:\n\n- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of\n    my eyes.''\n\nAre these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" They are saying\n\"exaggeration.\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions?

In April \n1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A \nnumber of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German\nofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian\nPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.\nPaikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his\nArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the\ncreation of an Armenian SS formation in order \n\n\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the \n spirit of the Nazi ideas.\"\n\nHe wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories\nof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish\nhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels\nPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language\nradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were\nproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]\n\n[1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.\n[2] Enno Meyer, A.

He played an important role in the\nestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any \nofficial position. His views were represented by his men in the\nrespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro\nand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.\nDro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after\na long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to\nBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] \n\nA minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not\n'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.\nAs such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians\nwere the least threatened and indeed most privileged.

EDT\n\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \nand opportunity in the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \nof a majority of the United States Senate. \n\t     \n\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\n\t     \n\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\n\t     \n\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \nnational needs.  \n\t     \n\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \nthe American people. \n\t     \n\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \ndramatic rise in violent crime. \n\t     \n\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \ncommunities all across our nation.\n\t     \n\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \n\t     \n\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \na brighter and more peaceful future.\n\t     \n\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \n\t     \n\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \n\t     \n\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \nAttorney General.\n  \n\t     \n\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \ndialogue?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \ntax.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\n\t     \n\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \naffordable health care system.\n\t     \n\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \njobs is one.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \nwe need to do that.\n\t     \n\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \nsafety of the public depends on that.  \n\t     \n\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \nreach some accord.  \n\t     \n\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \nconsistent with that.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you.\n\n                                 END3:12 P.M. EDT\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: bm562@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Richard L.

Some\n>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel\n>(the first is preferrable, of course)\n\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\n\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\nbecause\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\nscanning\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\nsome machines).\n\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\nonce\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\nwant to\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\nthe\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\nof\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\nwant\nto make stereo sound.\n\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\nthe\nIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\n\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\nhardware,\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\nworks.\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\n700/900/950\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\nonly.\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\nspecification,\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\n\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\n\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\nmachine\nyou have.\n\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\n>Lemmings\n>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\n>Glider 4.0\n>OIDS\nand also\nHellcats,\nSuper Tetris\nOxyd\n(and many more, these are just what I've tested)\n\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\n\n\nOther games you list:\n>Armor Alley\n>Spectre\n>Spaceward Ho!\nand also\nPGA Tour Golf\nCivilization\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\n\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\n\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\ndo,\nbut I'm going say it anyway.\nStop cheating on sound!\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\nis about to end.\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\nwork\neven better soon, so use it.\n\nIn conclusion:\nTo Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\nTo Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\nsound\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\nhardware.\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nDisclaimer number 1:\nI don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.\nSo don't write me with sound questions.\n\nDisclaimer number 2:\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like \"the grace period is about\nto end\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\nallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.\n\nDisclaimer number 3:\nI don't speak for Apple, just me.\n\n-Steve Bollinger\n"}, {"text": "From: tzs@stein2.u.washington.edu (Tim Smith)\nSubject: Re: Quadra SCSI Problems???\nOrganization: University of Washington School of Law, Class of '95\nLines: 21\nNNTP-Posting-Host: stein2.u.washington.edu\nKeywords: Quadra SCSI APS\n\n> ATTENTION: Mac Quadra owners: Many storage industry experts have\n> concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating\n> from the standard SCSI specification.

I figured, if Chuck posted the numbers, why not include where\nthey came from? (I also find it interesting that postitive info is \n\"fear, uncertainty & doubt\".)\n\n>Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very \n>unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success \n>of that OS.\n\n????  I think you've got me confused with someone else. I don't \npretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other\nOSes (including unix & OS/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary\nfeatures.  I also don't push people to use MSDOS; I even posted in\ncomp.os.msdos.misc that I suggest _waiting_ before installing a \nnew os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded \nduring release, unless the sales are a total bomb).\n\n>>I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,\n>>members of the BORG.\n>\n>That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more \n>defensive people in my life. \n\nI ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes. Do you *really*\nthink msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it?\n\nI just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie\ncutter. We don't all think alike.  Yeah, ChuckSt and I have some \"inside\"\ninfo on MSDOS - doesn't mean that everyone else does :)  \n\n>Seriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for\n>MS's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing.\n>I am sure that they ARE very talented etc ...
