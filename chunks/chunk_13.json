The\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\n\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\n\nSome personal thoughts:\n\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\nToday's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\n\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t\na clue what is in their heart.\n\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\nloving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no\nless abundant.\n\nThank you.\nPAX\n"}, {"text": "From: rlglende@netcom.com (Robert Lewis Glendenning)\nSubject: Don't fight Clipper Chip, subvert or replace it !\nOrganization: Netcom - Online Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)\nDistribution: na\nLines: 35\n\nClipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business\nor professional body in a position to establish a standard and\nprovide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission\nsystems.\n\nRSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of\na couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.\n\nLarge companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they\nall have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.\n\nIf we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to\nput our collective minds and interests toward establishing a\ncrypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to\nimplement it, we might avoid government control.\n\nOtherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.

Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.\n\nIt's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is\nusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car\nwith a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a\npoorer Cd. \n\nTo calculate drag use this formula:\n\nD = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S\n\nWhere D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),\nV is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the\npieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure\n(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). \n\nNote that power is:\n\nP = F * v\n\nWhere P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v\nis velocity (ft/s). \n\nNote that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for\nforce) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power\nresult in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. \n\nSo if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top\nspeed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)\n\n101 mph\n\nSorry to dissappoint.\n\n\n-- \nAl Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  'blad  Iaido  NASA\n\"Well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?\"\n                                             -Mary Chapin-Carpenter\n"}, {"text": "From: hagenjd@wfu.edu (Jeff Hagen)\nSubject: Re: Lois Chevrolet?\nOrganization: Wake Forest University\nLines: 22\nNNTP-Posting-Host: ac.wfunet.wfu.edu\n\n\n\nThe Chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the\nBuick Co. when Durant was there.\n\nWhen the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and\nothers with him.

If\n\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\n\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\nprohibitions.\n\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\n\n\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\n\t    in the Inquisition.\n\n\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\n\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\n\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\n\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\n\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\n\n\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\n\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\n\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\n\n\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\n\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\n\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\nof charges brought against them.)\n\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don't think that\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\nthe gospel, as if one's theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\nJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\n\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow\n>man?) And what is the \"right thing\"?  And how does one go about\n>loving god? \n\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\nthey *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\"\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\n\n>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo\n>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the\n>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.\n\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\nIt does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\n\n\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\n\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\n\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll\n\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\n\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\n\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\nsystem.\n\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\n\n>I am glad that a few Christians,\n>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then\n>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive\n>fashion.

Helsingius?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIDENTITY\n========\n\n_____\n<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\n  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\n  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\n  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,\n  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\n  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you\n  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete\n  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\n\n  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\n  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\n  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\n  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\n  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\n  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\n  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and\n  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\n  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\n  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\n  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of\n  real machines and represent real transfer routes.\n\n_____\n<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\n\n  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\n  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\n  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\n  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\n  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\n  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\n  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\n  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\n\n  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\n  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\n  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\n  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\n  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\n  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\n  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\n\n  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\n  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\n  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\n  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\n  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\n  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\n  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\n  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\n  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\n  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\n  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\n  exerting pressure for acceptance.\n\n  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\n  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \n  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\n  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\n  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \n  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\n  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\n  many government organizations push toward stronger identification\n  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\n\n  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\n  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\n  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\n  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\n  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will\n  literally be magnified exponentially.\n\n_____\n<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?\n\n  Your email address may contain information that influences people's\n  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as\n  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a\n  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,\n  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In\n  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others\n  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the\n  order that new users are added to the system.\n\n  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your\n  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this\n  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The\n  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on\n  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network\n  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields\n  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names\n  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as\n  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the\n  computer receiving mail.\n\n  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an\n  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more\n  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known\n  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist\n  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).\n\n  Common Suffixes\n  ---------------\n\n  .us    United States\n  .uk    United Kingdom\n  .ca    Canada\n  .fi    Finland\n  .au    Australia\n\n  .edu   university or college\n  .com   commercial organization\n  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)\n  .gov   government\n  .mil   military site\n \n_____\n<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?\n\n  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another\n  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.\n  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help\n  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve\n  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also\n  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address\n  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the\n  time and patience of others so use them minimally.\n\n  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the\n  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:\n\n    finger user@here.there.everywhere\n\n  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer\n  named in the address for information on the user named.  The\n  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may\n  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:\n\n  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is\n    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.\n  \n  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer\n    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger\n    utility may return this response in other situations.\n  \n  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some\n    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will\n    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all\n    actual full names of users kept in a local database.\n  \n  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the\n  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often\n  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid\n  user ID's to `crack' passwords.\n\n  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. \n  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses\n  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just\n  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use\n  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out\n  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be\n  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with\n  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one\n  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the\n  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through\n  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace\n  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.\n\n_____\n<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept\n  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent\n  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge\n  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. \n  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual\n  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic \n  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are\n  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique\n  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on\n  multiple machines anywhere in the world.\n\n  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\n  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to\n  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an\n  individual.  \n  \n  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,\n    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address\n    in the From: line.\n  \n  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as\n    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. \n\n  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:\n    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many\n    hackers.\n    \n  The status and path information prepended to messages by\n  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while\n  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in\n  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic\n  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification\n  on the internet:\n\n  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving\n    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for\n    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between\n    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding\n    addresses and bouncing mail.\n  \n  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,\n    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.\n  \n  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers\n    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved\n    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. \n  \n  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if\n    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even\n    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different\n    interpretations at different sites.\n  \n  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly\n  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was\n  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the\n  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic\n  is email, comprising  millions of messages.\n\n_____\n<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?\n\n  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images\n  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of\n  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.\n  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts\n  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises\n  in privacy.\n\n  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'\n  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend\n  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted\n  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity\n  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.\n\n\nPRIVACY\n=======\n\n_____\n<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and\n  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to\n  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the\n  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do\n  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, \n  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not\n  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly\n  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users\n  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want\n  any privacy, some expect and demand it.\n\n_____\n<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?\n\n  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing\n  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for\n  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.\n  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the\n  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted\n  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws\n  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These\n  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules\n  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global\n  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong\n  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic\n  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not\n  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly\n  discourages its regulation.\n\n_____\n<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?\n\n  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with\n    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the\n    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the\n    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes\n    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies\n    with supposedly vast funding and resources.\n  \n  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by\n    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine\n    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic\n    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to\n    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even\n    possible.\n  \n  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures\n    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can\n    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for\n    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is\n    prohibitive for casual use.\n\n  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major\n  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks\n  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost\n  completely defused with the use of cryptography.\n    \n_____\n<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?\n\n  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may\n  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. \n  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal\n  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to\n  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat\n  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the\n  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited\n  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to\n  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account\n  without detection.\n\n  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly\n  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what\n  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login\n  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or\n   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the\n  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it\n  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. \n  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting\n  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks\n  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on\n  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user\n  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of\n  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').\n  \n  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features\n  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies\n  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX\n  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed\n  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'\n  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect\n  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).\n  \n  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for\n  various reasons:\n  \n  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by\n    someone else. \n\n  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely\n    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over\n    many weeks. \n\n  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. \n\n  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or\n    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and\n    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous\n    ones.\n\n  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on\n    ``X Windows (in)security''.\n\n  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much\n  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help\n  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and\n  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:\n\n  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.\n  - Make sure to logout always.\n  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.\n  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.\n  - Avoid password references in email.\n  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.\n  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be\n    considerate.\n\n  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your\n  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX\n  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or\n  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for\n  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you\n  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware\n  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain \n  passwords.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?\n\n  The most important privacy considerations are related to file\n  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature\n  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with\n  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on\n  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these\n  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. \n  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete\n  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede\n  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a\n  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)\n  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list\n  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.\n \n  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the\n  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator\n  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights\n  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell\n  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary\n  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.\n\n  Examples\n  --------\n\n    traver.lance % ls -ld ~\n    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/\n\n  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home\n  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what\n  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a\n  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and\n  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For\n  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and\n  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The\n  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to\n  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They\n  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy\n  is completely invisible to them.\n\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\n    -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\n    traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\n    -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\n\n  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights\n  from `group' and `other'. \n  \n  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list\n  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files\n  and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,\n  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following\n  is possible:\n\n    ls foo\n\n  These commands would fail independent of file rights:\n  \n    ls -l foo\n    ls -l foo/file\n    cat foo/file\n    cd foo\n\n  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are\n  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'\n  readable file named `file':\n  \n    ls -l foo/file\n    cat foo/file\n    cd foo\n  \n  The following commands fail:\n  \n    ls foo\n    ls -l foo\n  \n\n  (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?\n\n  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena\n  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop\n  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing\n  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. \n  The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via\n  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application\n  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a\n  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many\n  situations the client is an application program running on the same\n  machine as the server.\n\n  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation\n  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a\n  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this\n  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated\n  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue\n  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be\n  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where\n  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is\n  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X\n  Windows.\n\n  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design\n  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely\n  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt\n  that display or read it electronically based on access to the\n  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections\n  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises\n  because the security is completely based on machine addresses\n  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is\n  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):\n  \n  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed\n  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in\n  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a\n  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not\n  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and\n  > mutual trust does not exist. \n  \n  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some\n  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0\n  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost\n  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an\n  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to\n  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display\n  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or\n  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on\n  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks\n  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security\n  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this\n  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'\n  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X\n  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). \n\n  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default \n  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority\n  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the\n  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code\n  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new\n  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with\n  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to\n  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of\n  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other\n  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find\n  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security \n  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local\n  sites often update this software infrequently because installation\n  is extremely complex.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, \n  Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall\n  <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?\n\n  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are\n  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for\n  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic\n  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every\n  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting\n  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is\n  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually\n  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth\n  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies\n  are only recently being established that afford high priority to\n  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some\n  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:\n\n  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous\n    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a\n    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),\n    such as a university. \n  \n  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement\n    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving\n    computer searches have still not been strongly established and\n    tested legally.\n\n  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in\n    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an\n    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human\n    other than the recipient.\n\n  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local\n    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be\n    overridden.\n\n  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of \n    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail \n    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.\n\n  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly\n  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has\n  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators\n  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or\n  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email\n  policies.''\n\n_____\n<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?\n\n  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke\n  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading\n  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or\n  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. \n  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator\n  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in\n  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are\n  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for\n  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators\n  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.\n\n  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.\n  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator\n  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by\n  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's\n  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are\n  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as\n  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on\n  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means\n  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring\n  unpopular opinions.)\n  \n  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to\n  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition\n  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of\n  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe\n  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options\n  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next\n  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'\n  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a\n  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).\n\n  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system\n  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings\n  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or \n  entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most\n  commonly associated with the following `abuses':\n\n  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'\n  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material\n  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the\n    poster instead of citing the content of the message\n  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness\n  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups\n    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive\n    files\n\n  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and\n  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via\n  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the\n  internet can be construed as representative of their parent\n  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in\n  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent\n  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case\n  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House\n  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some\n  guidelines:\n\n  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.\n  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private\n    communication.\n  - Use a disclaimer.\n  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).\n  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be\n    proprietary or `internal'.\n\n  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com\n  (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):\n\n  /pub/academic/banned.1991\n  /pub/academic/banned.1992\n  ---\n    Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991\n    and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.\n\n  /pub/academic/cases\n  ---\n    This is an on-line collection of information about specific\n    computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed\n    description of the items in the directory.\n\n  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability\n  ---\n    Notes on university liability for Usenet.\n\n_____\n<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?\n\n  The public information of your identity and account is mostly\n  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. \n  \n  - You have control over most of this information with the utility\n    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use\n    `passwd -f').\n   \n  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is\n    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. \n    \n  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is\n    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.\n    \n  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE\n    \n  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file\n    in your home directory.\n    \n  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult\n  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to\n  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). \n  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from\n  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely\n  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not\n  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your\n  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on\n  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on\n  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very\n  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.\n\n  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different\n  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and\n  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See\n  below.\n\n______\n<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?\n\n  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration\n  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely\n  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at\n  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely\n  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often\n  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more\n  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are\n  extremely strict.\n\n  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you\n  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files\n  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send\n  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he\n  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,\n  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ\n  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,\n  which can potentially be misused.\n\n______\n<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an\n  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large\n  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science\n  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as\n  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and\n  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to\n  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).\n\n  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been\n  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread\n  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some\n  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The\n  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually\n  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is\n  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).\n\n  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely\n  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders\n  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted\n  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to\n  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email\n  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently\n  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet\n  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost\n  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as\n  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).\n  \n______\n<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?\n\n  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or\n  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a\n  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate\n  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,\n  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will\n  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and\n  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that\n  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard\n  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.\n  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged\n  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with\n  the internet.\n  \n  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the\n  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to\n  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform\n  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption\n  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is\n  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.\n\n  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy\n  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly\n  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government\n  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe\n  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct\n  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new\n  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming\n  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out\n  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In\n  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong\n  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically\n  unstoppable.\n  \n  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure\n  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two\n  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of\n  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met\n  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,\n  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections\n  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and\n  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will\n  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few\n  years.\n\n\nANONYMITY\n=========\n\n_____\n<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?\n\n  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the\n  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on\n  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently\n  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a\n  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.\n  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single\n  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may\n  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with\n  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an\n  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a\n  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user\n  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the\n  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at\n  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some\n  service and hide all  signs of the association. \n  \n  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently\n  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking\n  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. \n  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed\n  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. \n  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will\n  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?\n\n  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or\n  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of\n  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the\n  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be\n  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true\n  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.\n\n  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague\n  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as\n  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information\n  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,\n  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,\n  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or\n  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information\n  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where\n  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely\n  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police\n  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of\n  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.\n  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with\n  assurances of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?\n\n  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in\n  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as\n  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be\n  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially\n  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF\n  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining\n  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous\n  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.\n\n  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently\n  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.\n  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee\n  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.\n\n_____\n<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?\n\n  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\n  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\n  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the\n  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\n  for the same person for different machine address email\n  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\n  to the server containing the final destination. The server\n  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\n  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\n  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \n  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\n  mentioned above.\n\n  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\n  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\n  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\n  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\n  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\n  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\n  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \n  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\n  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\n  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.\n  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. \n  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. \n  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any\n  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,\n  although actually may be held liable regardless.\n\n  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:\n  \n  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of\n    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained\n    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of\n    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been\n    implemented yet.\n\n  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\n    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the\n    use of cryptography for basic protection,.\n\n  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or\n    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.\n  \n  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic\n    that goes through them.\n\n  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. \n\n  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these\n    operators are basically  network users who do not own the\n    equipment and are accountable  to their own system\n    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic\n    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,\n    regarding it as illicit use. \n\n  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous\n    server operator by the user.\n\n  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP\n  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary\n  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the\n  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by\n  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data\n  and logs of network port connection information may be retained\n  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this\n  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some\n  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to\n  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished\n  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually\n  happening occasionally but infrequently.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?\n\n  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet\n  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,\n  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to\n  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to\n  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many\n  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the\n  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). \n  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''\n  before proceeding.\n\n  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a\n  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.\n  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed\n  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar\n  consequences can ensue.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available\n  to the general internet community, and these services should be\n  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its\n  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not\n  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and\n  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software\n  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: \n  \n  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous\n    return addresses. \n  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages\n    unaltered. \n  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced\n    to a remailer are common.\n  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly\n    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email\n    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with\n    the use of passwords.\n  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.\n  \n  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these\n  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The\n  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official\n  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is\n  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and\n  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable\n  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular\n  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system\n  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting\n  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have\n  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the\n  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only\n  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less\n  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least\n  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for\n  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,\n  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.\n  \n_____\n<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?\n\n  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase\n  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that\n  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,\n  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an\n  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers\n  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple\n  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be\n  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even\n  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers\n  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses\n  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)\n  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message\n  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.\n  \n  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,\n  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem\n  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many\n  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a\n  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in\n  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity\n  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and\n  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had\n  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the\n  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. \n\n  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may\n  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are\n  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could\n  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if\n  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may\n  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread\n  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It\n  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new\n  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater\n  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the\n  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social\n  acceptance of Usenet.\n\n\n* * *\n\nThis is Part 1 of the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ, obtained via anonymous\n  FTP to pit-manager@mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/net-privacy/ or \n  newsgroups news.answers, sci.answers, alt.answers every 21 days.\nWritten by L.

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8\nbits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This\ncolour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these\nmodifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped\nto this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a\n32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. \nHaving done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?\n\nApply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to\neach colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range\n0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth\ncolour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.\n\nYou could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how\nfar each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look\nrather odd.\n\nSo in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:\n\n>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How\n>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global\n>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and\n>>much more complicated.\n\n>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much\n>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.\n\nIn other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.\nTacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.\n\nAs to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If\nthat was not what you meant, then:\n\n>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many\n>places so far.)\n\nYes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting\nmade it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry\nif I misunderstood.\n\n>You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.\n\nYes again.

Also I use\nStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she \nwon't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from \nChili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom \nused offline files.  \n\nI plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly\ntempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around\nwith the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the \nshrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can\nhope can't I, after all, I have work to do).\n\nThe advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and \nhardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the \nupgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I\nstill need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) \nfrom some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation\ngoes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'm\nallergic to command lines!  I plan to run a \"pure\" NT system.  Also, will \nNT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently \nhave stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite \nDisk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the \nsystem (It's cramped now).\n\nI realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT \nversion?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk\nwill be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)\na comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask \nChili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd\nrather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without\nDOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?\n\nAny feedback or advice (including \"forget NT\" with good reasons) is much\nappreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better\nmultitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up\nthe machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),\nand I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe\nthere are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing \nabout them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?)\n\nPls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net.\n\nThanks,\nNathan Gregory\np00211@psilink.com\n\n"}, {"text": "From: watson@sce.carleton.ca (Stephen Watson)\nSubject: Re: Koresh Doctrine -- 4 of 4\nOrganization: Carleton University\nLines: 26\n\nQuestion for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists (Stephen\nTice, the Cotera, Joe Gaut, et al)(apologies if I've mislabelled any\nof you, I've only started reading t.r.m since the BD disaster.

It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a\nfloppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes\nthat file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT\nfrom the other disk written to the new disk.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n"}, {"text": "From: Steve.Hayes@f22.n7101.z5.fidonet.org\nSubject: Sin\nLines: 10\n\n09 Apr 93, Jill Anne Daley writes to All:\n\n JAD> What exactly is a definition of sin and what are some examples.

In practice,\ncommunism has \"solved\" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_\nproductive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the\nrest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.
