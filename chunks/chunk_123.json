I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\n\nI just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\nhaven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\n\n: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card\n: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down\n: in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc\n: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions\n: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to\n: come down in price.\n\nNo, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\nnobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:\neasily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or\nMac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.\n\n: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented\n: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better\n: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when\n: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.\n\nOn a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for\nexpandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The\nfollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:\n\nA (partial?) list:\n\t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \n\tconcurrently.\n\t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\n\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\n\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\n\t3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For\n\tinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor\n\t212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will\n\twork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the\n\ttermination, plug it in, and away it goes.\n\t4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\n\tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\n\tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\n\tto d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very\n\tnoticable, as many things can be going on at once.\n\nOne neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the\nability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with\nlittle problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've\nadded to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to\nhave 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive\nall on the same card.  \n\nSimply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.\n\nGreg.\n-- \n_______________________________________________________________________________\nYou can't go against nature, because when you do, \tGreg Shaw\ngo against nature, it's part of nature too.\t\tshaw@feanor.xel.com \n\t\t\tLove & Rockets\t\t\tuunet!csn!xel.com!shaw  \n"}, {"text": "From: tlau@cs.ubc.ca (Tony Lau)\nSubject: 3-D widget wish list?\nOrganization: University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada\nLines: 31\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cascade.cs.ubc.ca\nKeywords: 3-D widget, manipulation, feedback, user interface design system\n\nI am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing\n3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would\nlike to have in your applications.  \n\nA 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the \napplication.

If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \n>no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \n>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...

Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \n>Elaine's doctor a quack.\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \n>the candida or not isn't certain.\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \n>nondescript.  \n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \n>response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \n>from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \n>they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \n>bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \n>occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \n>for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \n>place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \n>but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \n>has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \n>specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \n>false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \n>basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \n>colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \"live with\nit\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \"you'll just have\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\nrecently rare power with their bats.\n\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \nbreaking balls.\n\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\n\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \nlater score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \nafter 4.\n\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\nTom Prince's two-base passed ball.  \n\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \nbeing of the \"bunt\" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith \"K'd\" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\n\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\nwork.\n\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \nbruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for \"precautionary\nX-rays\".  Let's hope he's OK.\n\nCincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the\ntwo wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!\nPittsburgh is now 7-6.\n\n*********REDS FANS***************************\nIf you would like to receive this report on a \nsemi-daily basis (as often as I write it), \nsend me your e-mail address and I'll put you \non the list.

The \"large\"\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\nthe energy they have absorbed.\n\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\nby any conceivable observation.\n\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\n\"average\" temperature.\n\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\n\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\nAllen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\ncooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of\nstarlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave\nbackground, and I believe that to be correct.)\n\n                         Dilution   Temp.

We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's\nBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's\nslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\nphisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\nhis \"enemies list.\"  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\na  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\nsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\na  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\nlongings if it beeps.\n\n     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\nwere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\nclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\neavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\nThough  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\nevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\n\n     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\ning  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\nthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\nthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\nnot).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\nmerit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\ntested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\nscribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"?\n\n     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\nover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\ncrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\nand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\nthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\nthe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\nget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\nformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\nelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\nachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\ncould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\narrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\nget.)\n\n     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\nlikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\nsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\nplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\nnot only against one another, but against their governmental\nmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\npiercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\nmedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\nCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\ntively, for its unlawful possession.\n\n     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\nlike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\nhandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\nmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\nand inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\ncalled \"the equalizer.\"  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\nin  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\nagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\nments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\nrepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  \"a  man  on\nhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\ncaptured.\"  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\nflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\ntrue one.\n\n     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\n(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\nalent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\nsuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's\nown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\nchange   information   over   an   insecure   communications\nchannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\nskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\nmet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\nputer, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\nX-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\nbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\ncations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\nTechnology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\nwill  have  totally demolished government's control over in-\nformation transfer.\n\n     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\nics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\ncalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\nwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\nthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\nlarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\ntwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    \"Ex-\ntremely\"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\ndigits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\neral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\ncomputer now in existence.\n\n     The  \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\nuct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\ntor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\n(q-1) + 1}.  The \"private\" part of the key consists  of  the\nother factor  y.\n\n     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\ninto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\nA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\nis then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\ninteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\ndecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\n(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\nyield the original number started with.\n\n     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\nit  is  called  \"public-key\"  cryptography,\"  is  that I can\nopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\nkeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\nan encrypted message, namely\n                       x\n                     a    (mod pq)  ,\nbut only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\nwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\nresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\nkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\neach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\nchange  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\ndisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\nthe secrecy of his own  y.\n\n     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig-\nital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of\na given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\nI raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\nyour pq)  and send that.\n\n    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\nraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\npq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\nsend this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the\nmessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\nthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\n(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\nginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\ncould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\ny).\n\n     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\nday tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\npersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\nAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\nputers  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\nfact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\ninterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\ncisely these students who one generation hence will be going\nhead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\nSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\nteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\nballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\ncomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\nmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\ntext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\nweren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\ncopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\nunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\ncessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\ncopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\nsively than machine guns are in the United States.)\n\n     Now  the  \"conservative\" position is that we should not\nsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\nthem  in weapons systems.  The \"liberal\" position is that we\nshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\ncooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there\nwill certainly be some other nation willing to.\n\n     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\nposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\nif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't\nwork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\nMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-\nscription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this\nis not a position that has gained much support among members\nof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\nter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we\nare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\nparticular  goal may not look anything like what most people\nwould consider a \"straight line.\"    Taking  a  long  enough\nworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\nment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\nthe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\nthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\nmissiles aimed at Moscow.\n\n     But  there's  the rub:  A \"long enough\" world view does\nsuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\nsimply  stupid  will \"get what they deserve,\" but what's not\nimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\nkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\n\n    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\ntack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\nfunctioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\nhamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\ngradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\npatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\nand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  \"feed  the  poor\"\nwhile also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\nup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\nsidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\ncrease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\nthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\npotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\nago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\nrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\nwas called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the Feds  swung\ninto  action.    For the first time in American history, the\nspeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\ncame an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\noil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\ncan oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\nsell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\ngrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\ngovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\nlowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\nto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\nwhat  can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil\nwar--the government against its own people?\"\n\n     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\nine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\ncourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\ncheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\ncompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\nbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\n\n     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\nhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\ncertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\nstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\nexists  almost  a  \"black  hole\"  effect in the evolution of\nnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\ndom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\nwarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\nthe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\nall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\nin the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments.  When those who\nsup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\nwhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\nchoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\ning  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\ndown to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just  two  people\non  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\na voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\nof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.\n\n     So essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of\nsome  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\nously  can't  use  the  altruists'  \"other-directedness\"  of\n\"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\na billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.\"\nRecognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\nis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.\nIf you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\n\"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\nto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\nworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\nto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\npeal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\nlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\nand say something like, \"Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\nnoble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\"\ngive  up  your  free  time  to  work for the \"cause,\" strive\nselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\nchildren are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-\nally  live under egoism\"--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And\nof course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to\nmake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\nwhen, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\nprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\nthen.\n\n     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\ntical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even\nnecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\nfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\ninvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\ning  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\nforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-\nterested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\nunilaterally.\n\n     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\nthe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\nready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\nthe saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often\nenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\nand moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I\nshall therefore repeat it now:\n\n     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\nfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\nfor a lifetime.\n\n     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\na  \"workfare\"  vs.  \"welfare\"  context;  namely, that if you\ngenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\nhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\nAnd of course this is true, if only because the next time he\nis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\nable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\nto fish, he is completely self sufficient.\n\n     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\ncontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\nglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\nagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\nslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\ntivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\nbeggars as we may encounter.\n\n     But consider:\n\n     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he\ndoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\nhave often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\nbecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\nthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\nthe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\nfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\nthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\ncategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\nthat  every  trade  must  have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the\nidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\n\"expense\" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\nscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\nthing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\nished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\n(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\ngame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  \"law  of\ndiminishing   returns,\"   the  \"first  and  second  laws  of\nthermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi-\nbilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's\nanarchy!\n\n     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\nEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\nnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\ncontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\ntells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\neven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's\nhealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\nadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought\nto be government property, and therefore it is the  function\nof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\nment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\nously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides\nto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\nall-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\nnot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\nthought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\"  But, in  any\ncase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\nlates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\nhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos-\nsession of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\"\n\n     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\noppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\naffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\nther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\nary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\nthis tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be \"altruistic\"  in\nthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\n\"egoistic\" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\noppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\nhaps even other motives.)\n\n     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\nyour \"cause,\" you're not about to mount a military campaign,\nor  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\nHowever, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\nformation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\nhundredfold.    I say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of\nthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\nsmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\nhundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\ngeted government, like present-day America, at least permits\nopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\nstricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\nattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\nyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\nyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\nyour mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as\nincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\nnonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\nre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\nhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\neological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\ncided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  \"Freedom  in  an\nUnfree World\" that the success of any endeavor is in general\ninversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\nsion is necessary to its fulfilment.\n\n     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\nbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\nLincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\nKhadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\nby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\nWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\nvasive, and not nearly so bloody.\n\n     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech\nProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\nslave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\nwork spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\nfreedom for ourselves.\n\n     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\npresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\nwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\nture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\nple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\nwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\ncommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\nfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\nThis law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\nit does indicate how government thinks.\n\n     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\npose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\nwho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the \"underground\nrailroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\nthe sovereign government of the United States of America  at\nthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\nas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\nlarly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\nferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\nalcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\nogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\nfor his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\nwhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\ndrug.\n\n     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\nconspirator  and pardoned felon . . . \"Let me make one thing\nperfectly clear:\"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\nparticipate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\nmatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\nsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\ntional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\nprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\nor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\ncensing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\nneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\nself.\n\n     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\ndespair,  thinking,  \"Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\nthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\nbefore  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\ngoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery\"--recognize\nthat  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-\nself free.\n\n     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,\nyou are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake\nname  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the\nmailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any\nfriends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested\nare welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-\naddressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-\nbels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared\nwith  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you\nshould have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to\nplug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.\nEven if you want to be the proverbial \"free rider\" and  just\nbenefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:\nEverything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or\ngive it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can\nget  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to\ngive it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist\nprofit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles\nshould make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly\nwilling to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-\nture.\n\n     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't\nlearn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they\noutlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before\nthey outlaw plowshares too.\n\n                                       --Chuck Hammill\n\n                                 THE LIBERTECH PROJECT\n                                 3194 Queensbury Drive\n                               Los Angeles, California\n                                                 90064\n                                          310-836-4157\n\n                                    hammill@netcom.com\n\n[The above LiberTech address was updated December 1992, with the\n permission of Chuck Hammill, by Russell Whitaker]\n\nThose interested in the issues raised in this piece should participate\nin at least these newsgroups:\n\n                alt.privacy\n                alt.security.pgp\n                comp.org.eff.talk\n                sci.crypt\n\nA copy of the RSA-based public key encryption program, PGP 2.1 (Pretty\nGood Privacy), can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world.\nOne such site is gate.demon.co.uk, where an MS-DOS version can be had by\nanonymous ftp as pgp22.zip in /pub/pgp.\n\nVersions for other operating systems, including UNIX variants\nand Macintosh, are also available.

Although the administrative \nmechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical \nexample of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism \nwhich shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood \nbehind its continuity. As a matter of fact, because Islamic principles \nwere in force in the Ottoman Empire, it was natural to use religious \ncriteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted \nthe Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the \n19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the \nexistence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to \nthe Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the \nOrthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were \nremnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians \nattached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian \nCatholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics \nattached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a \nPatriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a \nPatriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian \nCatholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13) \nNestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure \noutlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman \nEmpire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2] \n\n[1] N.

But if you can contrive\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\n\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\n\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\nthoughts.\n\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\ncommon by more than one person.  A\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\n\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\n\nSo... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\nof another alternative?  respond by post or email.\n\nthanks very much\n\n*dt*\n\n========================================================\n\n.\n"}, {"text": "From: an030@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Broward Horne)\nSubject: Re: Bush's WI\nReply-To: an030@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Broward Horne)\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH (USA)\nLines: 16\nNNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu\n\n\nIn a previous article, garrett@Ingres.COM (GREP A FRIEND) says:\n\n>In article <1qt61e$d7e@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu>, an030@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (B writes...\n>>        Went to the Post Office on Friday, got my passport apps in.\n>>        My savings have already been converted.\n>> \n>Bye.\n\n\n      Gosh.

I do remember calling Christianity\n\"silly\" and then following that up with information that I was nine years\nold when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually\ndishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's\nexistence. I define \"faith\" as \"belief in the absense of any proof\", BTW.\n\nAlso, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types\nthere, so in answer to your question: \"no.\"\n\nFinally, I'd hardly call Christianity \"beseiged\" in this country. I seldom\nsee Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing\ncrosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, of\ncourse, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happening\nis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people\nwho claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't\npracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority\nwho are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. \n\n>Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting\n>atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  \n\nThe implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I'm not a\nstudent of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and\nLinguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications\nI see are improper, please let me know.\nI'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as\nyou seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_\nthink I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that\nwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see\n\"atheist\" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve\nyour respect?\nAw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,\nhere. It's just that the \"nonsense\" thing really annoys me. I figure you\nshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to\nyour question.\nNow, the smoothed feather version:\nI seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I\nam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of\nChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.\nI've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't\nknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists\nI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist\nmotives here all you want (hence the \"amatuer\" psychology crack), but\nwithout an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.       \nI'm hoping people really\nwant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several\nreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I\nactually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the\nimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only \"broken\"\npeople are atheist.\n\tTry it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural\nstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many\npeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they \ndiscovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't\nfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous\nmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend\nto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions\nso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which \n\"breaks\" people.\nIt's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another\nreason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as \na watchdog for logical fallacies :).\n>I have a \n>difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>about the subject.     \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything\nabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my\nreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that\natheists are \"broken\", hostile people. This post confirms that someone\nelse believes it. \n\n>\n>Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says \n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\n>he will need to be proven wrong about it. \n\nWell, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of\nevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies\nlack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said\nthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a \"seeker\" if you like, I\ndon't. \n_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say \"I\ndon't believe in any god\" rather than my position: \"I believe that no\ngod(s) exist.\" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,\nbecause they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is\nconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and\nMethodists from an atheist point of view :).\nThis is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in\nsomething (followed up by \"everyone has faith in something\"). Guess what?\nMy atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is\nthat really too much to ask?\n\n\n>Well, I don't even waste my time trying. \n\nWell, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why the\nsupposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is\nit because you yourself are unconvinced? :) \n\n> I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it.\nAnd I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that\nI can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.\nI have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm \"broken\"?\nI tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that\nyou should just take my word for it.

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \n\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \ndiseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to \"slide\" past vessels and            \nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that \nhaven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \n\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu\n                                                                                                    \n  \n"}, {"text": "From: nickh@CS.CMU.EDU (Nick Haines)\nSubject: Vast Bandwidth Over-runs on NASA thread (was Re: NASA \"Wraps\")\nIn-Reply-To: wingo%cspara.decnet@Fedex.Msfc.Nasa.Gov's message of 18 Apr 1993 13:56 CDT\nOriginator: nickh@SNOW.FOX.CS.CMU.EDU\nNntp-Posting-Host: snow.fox.cs.cmu.edu\nOrganization: School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University\n\t<17APR199316423628@judy.uh.edu> <1993Apr18.034101.21934@iti.org>\n\t<18APR199313560620@judy.uh.edu>\nLines: 12\n\nIn article <18APR199313560620@judy.uh.edu>, Dennis writes about a\nzillion lines in response to article <1993Apr18.034101.21934@iti.org>,\nin which Allen wrote a zillion lines in response to article\n<17APR199316423628@judy.uh.edu>, in which Dennis wrote another zillion\nlines in response to Allen.\n\nHey, can it you guys.

I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever\nfelt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.\nThis is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear\nof getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is\nhopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did\nnot answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,\na lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint\nof her existence.\n\n> Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe. So .. ?\n\nI suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe\nand analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\n\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit\nthat I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.\n\n> No one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let\n> me ask you a question.

I learned what it means to use _reason_.\n\nAs a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis\nof a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and \n> what not to?\n\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\nevidence. \n\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\n\n> There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.

Those who do are usually remembered\nas heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm\nlying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is \nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\n\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing.
