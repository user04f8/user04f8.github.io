The BATF are serving a warrant on someone who they feel might\n have illegal automatic weapons. If they expected, as you state, that `the B-D\n to be anything other than peaceful citizens' they could have sent one, maybe \n two agents up to the front door, knock, and attempt to serve the warrant on\n the person answering the door. Scenario one, that person lets them in to \n perform the search and no one gets hurt. Scenario two, the person answering\n the door pulls a weapon aand kills both officers. Now you have two dead BATF\n agents instead of four, the BATF knows exactly where they stand with regards\n to the BD and began to formulate a plan of action to arrest those responsible\n without harm to the innocent people/children within the compound.\n\n\n> \n>The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by\n>ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police. \n\n\n No, the stupidity was the attempt to serve the warrant SWAT style.\n\n\n> \n> \n>If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing\n>the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could\n>hear it.\n\n\n Sure, do it within the law.

A reader down the road will get the impression that the\nmother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just\na casual statement.\n\nFinally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be\nfulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, \"Beware, the\nterminal will unexpectedly be shut off!\" and then after 2 secs I turn\nit off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was\nno prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of\nthe Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it\nwas predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time has\ncome.  (I've read this somewhere, but can't think of the source - if\nyou can, please let me know.)  In this case, the establishment of the\nstate does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used\nin order to push for the establishment of the state.\n\nDeciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky.\n\n-leo\n\n-- \n\"My mother wanted to save herself until marriage.

Timing is as follows;\n\n     1993 May 1-2\n\n        A-ring ingress  18:27\n               egress   19:30\n        B-ring ingress  19:51\n               egress   21:42\n        C-ring egress   23:00\n        Saturn ingress  23:59\n               egress   10:02\n        B-ring ingress  10:28\n               egress   12:19\n        A-ring ingress  12:40\n               egress   13:43\n\n     1993 July 20-21\n\n        Saturn ingress  21:16\n               egress   05:08\n        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)\n               egress   09:38\n\nTimes could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,\nand photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'\norbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from\nIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about\nthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy\nand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell\nof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my\nattention.\n\nTHERMAL OBSERVATIONS?\n\nJay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:\n\n  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July\n  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,\n  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,\n  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\n\n  Jay\n\nand again:\n\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\n\njay\n\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: haase@meediv.lanl.gov (Peter Haase)\nSubject: Seeking FAX For Network Access\nOrganization: Los Alamos National Laboratory\nLines: 9\n\nI am seeking recommendations/Vendors for a Networkable FAX.

He/she cannot\nmake laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say\nscam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.

The new cryptography scheme was\nannounced today by the White House and the National Institute\nfor Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the\ntechnical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman\nacknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\nsecret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the\nencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\n\n        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the\nPresidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To\nopen the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today\nfiled a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests\nwith key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security\nCouncil and the FBI for information relating to the encryption\nplan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the\nComputer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to\nopen the development of non-military computer security standards\nto public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of\nsuch standards.\n\n        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in\ndeveloping the so-called \"digital signature standard\" (DSS), a\ncommunications authentication technology that NIST proposed for\ngovernment-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA\nlawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first\ntime that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.\nNSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying\nthe classification of records concerning its creation of the\nDSS.\n\n        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the\nadministration's apparent commitment to the privacy of\nelectronic communications, as reflected in today's official\nstatement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned\nthe propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent\nsecrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from\npublic scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the\ndevelopment of a new information infrastructure, it is vital\nthat standards designed to protect personal privacy be\nestablished openly and with full public participation.  It is\nnot appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of\nsecrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to\nplay a leading role in the development process.\"\n\n        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer\nindustry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of\ntechnology on society.

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). \n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Each report published in the CDC \nSurveillance Summaries focuses on public health surveillance; surveillance \nfindings are reported for a broad range of risk factors and health conditions. \n     Summaries for each of the reports published in the most recent (March 19, \n1993) issue of the CDC Surveillance Summaries (1) are provided below.

The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\n                           Management of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\n"}, {"text": "From: MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)\nSubject: Re: An Anecdote about Islam\nIn-Reply-To: jaeger@buphy.bu.edu's message of 5 Apr 93 16:49:14 GMT\nOrganization: Unorganized Usenet Postings UnInc.\nX-News-Reader: VMS NEWS 1.24\nLines: 24\n\nIn <114127@bu.edu> jaeger@buphy.bu.edu writes:\n\n[deletia]\n\n> I don't understand the point of this petty sarcasm.

Baseball is entertainment, and I have no\nquarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than\nothers, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the\nslug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of\nit.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.\n\nOf course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga's\ninability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he \"isn't\npaid to walk\" or \"is an RBI guy\" or whatever.\n\n>And finally, I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw \n>their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike\n>to them, than because they have a great \"eye\"\n\nI'm not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming\nconvinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical\nability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the\nchance to do it a lot.\n\nLet's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether\nthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:\n\n\n\t\t\tPower\t\t\tNo Power\n\n\tPatient\t\tFrank Thomas\t\tBrett Butler\n\t\t\tBarry Bonds\t\tOzzie Smith\n\t\t\tMark McGwire\t\tCraig Grebeck\n\t\t\tBabe Ruth\t\tMiller Huggins\n\t\t\tTed Williams\t\tBilly Hamilton\n\t\t\tRickey Henderson\tEddie Joost\n\t\t\tJoe Morgan\t\tMike Hargrove\n\t\t\t   .\t\t\t   .\n\t\t\t   .\t\t\t   .\n\t\t\t   .\t\t\t   .\n\n\tImpatient\tErnie Banks\t\tOzzie Guillen\n\t\t\tDave Kingman\t\tShawon Dunston\n\t\t\tJoe Carter\t\tAndres Thomas\n\t\t\tGeorge Bell\t\tJose Lind\n\t\t\tKirby Puckett\t\tDevon White\n\tetc.\n\nAs far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the\ntwo are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at\nthe plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being\nsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of \ntarget at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;\nhe's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all\nover the place, despite his huge strike zone.\n\n\n-- \n   David M.

When we\ndo something to make a particle \"appear,\" we are actually causing\nall the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is\none line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some\nof the scientific community.\n\nDr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused\nby the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that\nmind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates\nthat if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness\nis the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).\n\nIt all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that\nthis would explain the phenomenon of \"magick\" as practiced in my\nreligion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind\ncould be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of\npossible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of\ncommunication between ones current, and possible future selves. \nI have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self\ndelusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection\nof one of many possible futures.\n\nI realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep \nan open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile \nexplaination of the world in which we find ourselves.

I got my\nfirst one in college about 5 or so years ago.\n\n\tI've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for\npast 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I\ngot software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister\nand father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go\nfor one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's).\nThe original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would\nsay that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one\n(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.\n\n\tMy brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it\nto him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief\nadvantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:\n\nAdvantages:\tQuick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's\nprinting), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't,\nso look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet\nAppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one\nDW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to\ncolor or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I\nreceived many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp\nlaser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those\nImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25\nper sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all\nhours of the night....)\n\nDisadvantages.\tInk used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and\nwasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink\n(I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and\nrunning (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your\nbookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts\n(I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to\n$12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but\nI don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of\nabout 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after\nfooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing\ndoesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the\npaper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.\nOther disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in\nspeed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press\nsoftware solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but\nthey won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.\n\nIn the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript\n(unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even\nwhen soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only\ninstance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board\nTransparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser\nPostscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB\nnegatives directly onto a transparency.\n\nWell, hope my babbling has helped.\n-squish@endor.harvard.edu\n\n"}, {"text": "From: jongsma@esseye.si.com (Ken Jongsma)\nSubject: 9600BPS External Modem\nReply-To: jongsma@tws4.si.com\nOrganization: Smiths Industries\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 12\n\nI have a Practical Peripherals 9600sa (External) modem for sale.\nIt's been used less than 1 year and has a lifetime warranty.

In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\naren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\nfalse?\n\n-------------\n\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.

I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.\n\n--clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: system@kalki33.lakes.trenton.sc.us (Kalki Dasa)\nSubject: Bhagavad-Gita 2.44\nOrganization: Kalki's Infoline BBS, Aiken, SC, USA\nLines: 42\n\n                                TEXT 44\n\n                       bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam\n                           tayapahrta-cetasam\n                        vyavasayatmika buddhih\n                          samadhau na vidhiyate\n  \nbhoga--to material enjoyment; aisvarya--and opulence; prasaktanam--for\nthose who are attached; taya--by such things;\napahrta-cetasam--bewildered in mind; vyavasaya-atmika--fixed in\ndetermination; buddhih--devotional service to the Lord; samadhau--in\nthe controlled mind; na--never; vidhiyate--does take place.\n    \n                              TRANSLATION\n\n\tIn the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and\nmaterial opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute\ndetermination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take\nplace.\n  \n                                PURPORT\n\n\tSamadhi means ``fixed mind.''

My\nmachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from\nwhen I called the order in. \n\n   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the \nperipherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I\nwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway \ndocumentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.\nThe Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came\nwith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)\nwas properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and \nhas been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \nlot to do with it. \n\n   It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \"maps\" the other\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \"cd\" to these\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\nIt's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \n\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\n\n  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it\nwas me.

This is a pretty broad \n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\n motosports enthusiasts.\n\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\n\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \n\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\n ---------------------------------\n\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\n\n\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\n (depending on the topic). \n\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\n       list directly.\n \n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\n \n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\n\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\n ----------------------------------\n\n It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\n day.\n\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\n\n\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\n -----------------------\n\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\n\n\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\n (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\n based mail systems). \n\n BOUNCES\n -------\n\n Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com).

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on\nthe part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my\nopinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the\nJews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this\nagreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might\ngrant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but\nnothing in the archives and available literature indicates that\nthis was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin\nMASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the\nPalestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to\nyour belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later\nadvertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was\nuseful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians\nwere rightfully scared off, because they did not want another\nDeir Yassin.  \n\tI'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;\natrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.\nIsraelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are\nand were the good guys in the middle east.
