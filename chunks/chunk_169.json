IMO, the latter is a nice\nand unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not\nthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of\npeople that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.\n\nIf the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not \ncentral to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is\nwhether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'\nwould have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to\nplay in.

(Though Christians may well hold beliefs\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \ntopics.)\n \n>Some take it to the extreme and say that\n>their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings\n>then you won't be \"saved\". \n\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\n \n>It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim\n>to know what God thinks/wants. \n\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \nthey have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks\nand wants.\n\n>Especially when it's based upon your\n>interpretation of a book. \n\nMost Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living\ntradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly\nby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\n\n>The logic in the above statement is faulty\n>in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be\n>correct. \n\nIf depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \nmay both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\n \n>It's all about perception.

You assert that anyone who believe that we can find \nabsolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.\n\n>As an example, take the question, \"Is the glass half\n>empty or half full\"? You can have two different answers which are\n>contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be\n>true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.\n\nHere I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the\nknowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass \nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\n \nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\nto understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\nto say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, \nbut if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long\nas we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other \nas in error.\n-- \n==============================================================================\nMark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

Many sites are listed as\n    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on\n    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP\n    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via\n    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com\n    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions\n    on how to make requests.\n\n    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames\n    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.\n\n    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is\n    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.\n\n\nVIEWING IMAGES\n\n    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly\n    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To\n    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,\n    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\n    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP\n    sites.\n\n    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image\n    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document\n    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at\n    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory\n    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.\n\n\nONLINE ARCHIVES\n\n    NASA AMES\n\n    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via\n    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and\n    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press\n    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please\n    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.\n\n    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in\n    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the\n    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).\n\n    To access the archives by email, send a letter to\n    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the\n    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:\n\n\tsend SPACE Index\n\tsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.\n\n    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in\n    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use\n    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this\n    section for images or programs.\n\n    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image\n    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The\n    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are\n    available in these collections.\n\n    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory\n    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in\n    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is\n    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item \"VIEWING IMAGES\" below).\n\n    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to\n    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing\n    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.\n\n    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee\n    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).\n\n\n    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM\n\n    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and\n    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data\n    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140\n    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can\n    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS\n    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,\n    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to\n    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,\n    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.\n\n    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to\n    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu.

Also included are suggested classroom\n    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a\n    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA\n    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it\n    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments\n    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered\n    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by\n    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during\n    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop\n    between the user and NASA.\n\n    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs\n    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images\n    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.\n\n    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8\n    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov\n    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the\n    Internet.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\n\n    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to\nyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader\nthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).\n\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\n\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\n\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\n\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\n\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\n    are other sources, use them, too.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could we do this on the lawn?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out \nto the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the stimulus package dead? \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You \nsaid it was a good visit, but no compromise.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk \nwith Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there \nwere no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \ngood discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \nwell.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \nTuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \nspeak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \nPresident was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \nof that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \nPresident about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \nabout that yesterday afternoon.\n\t     \n\t     At the close of that discussion they said that they \nwould have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \nwas up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \ncompromises made on either side, they did say that they would \ncontinue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are \nboth making concessions?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that \nphase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said \nconsistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \nHe believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to \ntake adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to \nmake those adjustments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the subject of a VAT --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can we stay on this for one more minute?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We have a problem with the five minutes --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I know no decisions have been made, but what would \nlead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go \ndown that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said \nthis morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a \nnumber of other organizations have recommended that this be looked \nat.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been \nmade.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To follow, have they done that directly through \nhim?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President \nabout it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although \nthere's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the \nVAT.  But the President has not made a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At the meetings that he's had with his own task \nforce advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the \npossible options would be?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been \npresented for a decision, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an \noption?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of \nbriefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the \nPresident as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're not saying he didn't know it was being \nconsidered, though, are you?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He knew that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  \nThat's what I'm asking.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being \nconsidered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been \nover the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I \ndon't even know that it's --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at \nthis stage?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're \ngetting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is \nconsidered -- \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed \nit.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \nrepeated. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, is there any concern here that as a result \nof the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \nit were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out \nthe way it did, that there may now be the development of a \ncredibility gap on this issue and others?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is \nnow public knowledge that this is being considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \nstatements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \nwas off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \ncome out not from you people, but --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \nfrom the administration.  What are you talking about?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said \nhe would let us know. \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \nit's not going to be on the program.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On March 25th. \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \nby rooting around in the fine print of an interview\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \na very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\n(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \nwrite a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \nClinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right \nhere, and AP story -- \"Clinton wants more money for spying.\"\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about his remark that if it were being \nconsidered, he'd tell us about it?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, \nand he'd let you know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And did he?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \nthis morning?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of \nme.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \nHealth of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \nadministration.  That is his administration policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \norchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \nanswered the questions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're saying here that it didn't have to be \ndragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \nconsidering it.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \nPainfully clear.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was there a particular political strategy in making \nit clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \nday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \nconsidered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \nanswered that it was being considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, The New York Times --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why do it yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \nReich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \noranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures \nin a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, \nbut which turned out to be totally false.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally \nfalse, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \nDepartment did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \nsay that. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The question is, is the President concerned about \nbehavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he \ndoing about it, if so?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \nmistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the \nmatter.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't that the same information that goes to the \nPresident?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of \ninformation.  I think that's where the confusion was.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When did you all first learn about this mistake \nthat was made?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \nThe New York Times?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \nAnything?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on \nthis for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both \nstatements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \nmixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \nit was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \nchoose to spin or make an issue of?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \nwork, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to \nget this jobs package going.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \nminute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \namendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \nwould be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \nthe conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \nthat off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no \nchanges in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the \ntiming like that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer \nthis week than you were last week?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going \nto pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \nadjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the \nvotes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's \ngoing to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \ndeeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has there been any indication that this situation \nhas changed?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on \nit.  We'll know when the votes are taken.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, last week you said that there are -- or \nvarious people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go \nthrough Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \nhe was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \ncompromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \naccept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've \nrealized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted \nto talk to the President about the stimulus package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He initiated the conversation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \nthe President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \nsay he's making --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly \nwhat he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that \nthere was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \nand the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President \ndoesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \nit through, he will.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \nworking on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \nthe actual vote.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Today?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will \nhappen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward \nwith some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \nforward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \npassed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \nfirst one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you \ntonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \nis.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how \ndetailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \npackage last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \nafternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \nin the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \nDole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \ncompromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  \nAnd I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \nwe've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \nPresident and Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \nto talk to Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \nhow about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \nPresident, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation \nin that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they discuss actual numbers?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they \ntalked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \nabout the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the \nlevel of this many x-billion dollars. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \npackage?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the White House have anything to do with the \nprotesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \nwas speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And has the President been in touch with Senators \nKohl or Feingold?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, \nno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, is the President considering the more \npalatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \nhaves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \nto scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \nhaving to pay for the have-nots?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \nthe tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \nbudget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \nquestion, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \nyou suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \nthat would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \nnot true.  It's actually waste water money.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for \nWisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \nbecause it's waste water money, right?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \noverall. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But the implication from your statement the other \nday was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \nWould you agree that's not the case?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I \nknow that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \nwhen did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \non a VAT?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just \ndon't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \nthe time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So sometime since March 25th?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know \nthe exact date.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, the President this morning mentioned that \nsome labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \nbeing okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \nthat perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, \nor is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already \nproposed?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to \nsay about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is \nbeing considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \nThe President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't \nbe to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the \nincome tax, for instance?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \nthat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \nSenator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \nthink -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \nhave a chance?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \nforward?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \nif the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration \nnow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \ncircumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \nconsideration.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \nthis morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \nthat has to be considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \nThat's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \nit out that groups have asked it to be considered?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that true?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \ntaxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the \ndeliberations.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But, George --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \nthe President said, groups came forward and said this is something \nyou ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that the only thing that's changed since his \nprior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \ninformation got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \nthe newspaper or did groups make presentations?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \nthe health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But this is the President's knowledge that these \ngroups had come forward.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \nwas coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \npublished positions in the newspapers.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's \npresentations to them?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him \n-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \nworking groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \ngroups.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \nwere persuasive enough that the President would change the position \nthat he had enunciated previously?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had \nlongstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \nhealth care.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding \npositions?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \nObviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the \nbasic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're \ntelling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \nchange in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February \nand now --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't \nnecessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I know, but the President said that it was off the \ntable.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's \nchanged is the positions of these groups, except you're also \ndescribing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  \nIf these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been \nmade to the President --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the \npresentations to the health care task force.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's no relationship at all between the fact \nthat sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \nfavored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested \nthat they would produce all the revenue.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \nappropriate ways to finance health care.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that \nhe said anything to refute that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \nthere wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \nof core benefits --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task \nforce ever suggested that there would.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \nhis promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \nprograms?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical \nsituation.\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \nraise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \nfrom seeking a VAT tax?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \non the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the \nimplications then.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \nlabor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \nforce has prompted this consideration?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just \ndon't have that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \nalternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \nother financing options are also still on the table and what these \noptions are?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \nand representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \nat a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \nthere are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not \ngoing to comment --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the scope --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on \nthem, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you \ntalking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task \nforce is looking at.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the \nMiyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \nPresident hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \ntask complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \nthe remark about market access at the press conference?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does no mean yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes and no.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the \nPrime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question \nabout that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \nhe was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \ncertainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \nPresident.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \nthe U.S. that we want to do something about.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \nsuggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \nterms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \nour views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \nvery clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your \ncharacterization of the Prime Minister's comments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that we need specific export targets, specific \nnumerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with \nMiyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad \ndiscussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into \nthose specifics until after the meeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \nnot -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \ntargets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \nhopeless that this is going to change very much?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \nhave pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \nwant to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does the President believe that their stimulus \npackage announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \nto get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \nMiyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \nbe some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \nChristopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \nmore, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to \nwork with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to \npress for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \nthink that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \nwe're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \npackages.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work \nwith all our allies to do as much as we can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \nShow this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on \nthe Bosnia policy.  And he said, \"It's a rather emotional response.\"  \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \nHouse condone that kind of remark?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \nChristopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \nthat this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find \nanswers for. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But that specific -- \"rather emotional response\" -- \nspecific term?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with \nthe numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \ngood American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \nto help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \nair strikes, anything that can be done?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \nmust be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \nyou know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \nembargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \npressure at this time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is your response to the critics who would say \nthat the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \nthe presidency?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard \nfor the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard \nfor increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the \narms embargo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \ngetting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \nthat military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \nchange your thinking?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to \nwhatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \nsay.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \nand talking about the arms embargo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \nsaid she would be able to provide some administration officials who \ncould document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \nyou going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That's exactly what she said.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But \nwhat she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \nevidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \nconnections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \nwe are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \nan effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \nwhat kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \neffect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \ninto Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \nkind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't \nknow.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \nall, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be \nreleased?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  \nAnd it will be probably later today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the President considering signing an executive \norder banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \nforce as part of the gay rights march here next week?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal \nfor that at this time, not that I know of.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's something that the President promised during \nthe campaign that he would do.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't \nthink it's anything that's on his plate right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \non this issue?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  \nI assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \ncommunity sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \ndifferent groups and communities.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know if that's scheduled --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's a good thing you asked.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How long --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I \ndon't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \nspeech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but \nI think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \ngive a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not \nexactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \nthat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \nthe biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific \ntiming of something like that, but it's certainly something under \ndiscussion and something we've been working on.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Campaign finance reform?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think it will be next week?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working \non?  I missed the question.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  \nHe asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know \nanything about that but it's something we've certainly been working \non.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know what organizations might be represented \nin this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out \nof town on the day of the march?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate \nmeeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a \nspeech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston \non Sunday, as he did last year.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you \non the question?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the gays.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the \nPresident's schedule for the day, certainly.\n\t     \n\t     Q?\t    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is \nthat Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one \nday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how \nlong the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't \nknow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting \n-- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you \nabout it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the \nfirst time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  \n\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in \nthe Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's \nnot, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     at the White House in the Bush administration \ngay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White \nHouse had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make \nsure --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do \nanything like that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Certainly not.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What marching orders did the President give to \nGeneral Vessey?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for \nabout half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was \nhe had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will \nobviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  \nThe President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting \nand said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes \nin our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's \nresponse to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look \ninto investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on \nremains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to \nmilitary archives.  \n\t     \n\t     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the \nactivities of the joint commission and on the document.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Vietnam says it's a fake.

I would \npoint out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \nany of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How many questions?\n\t     \n\t     MR.

And I would point out further that the \narticle also implied that these questions were only answered at \ntightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \nHe's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \nOffice or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \nquestions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --\nEast Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval \nOffice, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the \nRoosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \nPress Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local \ntelevision anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The \nPortland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \nHe's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \nConnecticut --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you address the question of the attitude?

(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The story is that you -- are you held responsible \nfor it.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment \nabout this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you denying that the President has shown \ndispleasure publicly?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the \ndiscussions between the President and myself.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President write that letter to Chris \nWebber?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball \nplayer?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That is an authentic letter?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \nFebruary, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \nbe exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \nDoes he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a \nproposal he hasn't made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, does the President have some agenda for \nthis meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a \ngeneral meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about \nincluding AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The military issue?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, what specifically is the President doing to \nprepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had \ngeneral discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \nTrade Representative and others.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     report yet?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report \nreferred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him \ntoday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He was?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he intend to use any of these instances that \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the \nreport's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \nhard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \nthat there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \nfeels that way?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \nrecord in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \nI think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The \nthrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the \nPresident may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he \nhas the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent \nhistory.\n\n\t     Q\t  Can we come up to your office?

From a network administrator's implementation,\nhe/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.\nThen install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network\nto install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers\nare available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.\n \nAdvantages:\n- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to\n  the local access of main Windows files.\n- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point\n  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing\n  and reduce the cost of down-time.\n- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard\n  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network\n  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster\n  access than local ones.\n- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about\n  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the\n  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.\n \nDisadvantages:\n- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk\n  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can\n  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.\n- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to\nadminister.\n  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of\n  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.\n- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system\n  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for\n  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.\n- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup\n  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.\n  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be\n  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable\n  applications and *not* user data.\n \nThe SHARED Windows Installation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWindows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure\ndescribed above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of\nfiles to individual \"user\" directories.  These directories may be on a\nlocal hard disk or perhaps a network \"home\" directory.  The bulk of the\nWindows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory\n(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout\ntheir Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files\nthat the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include\ngroup files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.\n \nAdvantages:\n- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As\n  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this\n  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.\n- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,\n  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct\n  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.\n- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files\n  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with\n  all driver updates.\n \nDisadvantages:\n- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network\n  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the\n  speed of Windows.\n- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's\n  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs\n  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will\n  usually not be able to save their work.\n- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files\n  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a\n  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows\n  files alone.\n- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation\n  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being\n  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).\n  \nThe Discussion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows\nuserbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have\nsetup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and\napplication files are on the network with little or no utilization of\nlocal hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the\ncompany would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations\nand thus save that much more money.\n \nI would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should\napps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how\nWindows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy\nbackup and administration but this is \"putting all eggs in one basket\";\nif the network crashes, work comes to a halt.\n \nNow I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own\nideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to\nhear from people with \"actual\" working experience with users and network\nadministration.\n \n\n"}, {"text": "From: rdell@cbnewsf.cb.att.com (richard.b.dell)\nSubject: Re: Lead ACid Batteries Part 2!!!\nOrganization: AT&T\nLines: 39\n\nIn article <1993Apr27.211036.1@ulkyvx.louisville.edu> jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu writes:\n>In article <1993Apr26.221422.17208@mprgate.mpr.ca>, vanderby@mprgate.mpr.ca (David Vanderbyl) writes:\n>\n<lots of stuff deleted>\n\n>The lead-acid secondary cell discharge reaction is EXOTHERMIC.

Yes, although it does use up a \nlot of memory.\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \nthe Portable is Backlit or not.

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"}, {"text": "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr@igc.apc.org>\nSubject: From Israeli press.

This could be encrypted after\nthe message.  The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with\na message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting\nblock.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that*\nsure....)  Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be\nstronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's\nunbreakable.\n \n   A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's\nto include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad,\neither.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your\npad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your\nopponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext\nin a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going\non.\n \n   If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide\nwhether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use\nof 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about\nhalf.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a\nguess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm trying\nto see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the\nspoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-\nsynched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.\n \n   Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure\nas a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.\n \n   For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together\nto get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy\nhas no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either.\nAny change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess\nof what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits?\n \n   Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random\nbits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messages\njust as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.\nIn fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed\nmessage with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about\nthat.\n \n   Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the\none-time pad?\n \n   --John Kelsey\n"}]}
