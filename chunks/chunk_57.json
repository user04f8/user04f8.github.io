I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's\nMS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some\nsites in the U.S.  The three I found were:\n\n1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)\n                                This was the smallest and simplest\n   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.\n   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra\n   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the\n   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press\n   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would\n   have been nice if there was an \"ALWAYS ON TOP\" setting for the little\n   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified\n   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be\n   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace\n   manager makes it an attractive package.\n\n2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)\n                               While this workspace manager offered a\n   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming\n   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace\n   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \"snapshots\"\n   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what \n   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,\n   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.\n   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in\n   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this\n   viewing functionality which is quite useful.\n\n3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)\n                            This is an interesting package, which contains\n   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies\n   include \"Backmenu\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you\n   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu\n   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,\n   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could\n   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also\n   bundled in \"backdesk.zip\" is a program called \"WRUN\", which allows\n   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS\n   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  \n   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite\n   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it\n   doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.\n   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,\n   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to\n   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different\n   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which\n   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window\n   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically\n   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area\n   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up\n   of a particular section.\n\nTry each of them out for yourself.  I was impressed with all of them,\nso find out which one suits your needs the best.\n"}, {"text": "From: hayesstw@risc1.unisa.ac.za (Steve Hayes)\nSubject: Re: When are two people married in God's eyes?\nOrganization: University of South Africa\nLines: 27\n\nIn article <Apr.16.23.15.27.1993.1836@geneva.rutgers.edu> cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk (Michael C Davis) writes:\n\n>: I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged\n>: couple become \"married\" in God's eyes?

You are correct, it is illegal to send cryptographic\ncode (and lots of other things) out of the country without a license.\nHOWEVER, every US citizen has a general export license, allowing\nexport of lots of things, including constitutionally protected speech.\nThis has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export some\nthings which it is illegal for a US corporation to export without\nfirst obtaining a license.\n\n   > Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only\n   > way to find out is to apply for a license.\n\n   Nope, talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law.  But, in\ngeneral, the government has to have a very good national security case\nto try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to\npublish.  (Yes, I worded that the way I did intentionally.  It is a\nlot easier for the government to TRY to prevent the export of\ninformation than to charge someone with a crime after the fact.\nEspionage is probably the only exception.)\n\n   > Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send\n   > to Canada if YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send\n   > if you don't.\n\n    If you are a US citizen, you have a general license.  (I am not a\nlawyer, so take some of this with a grain of salt.  However, I have\nalso had to swim through both ITAR and export regs in a few cases.)\n\n--\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRobert I.

(A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols.  Who knows?\nShe may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.)

Something is\nbeing done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games\nby 15 minutes.  Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches.  Given the increasing\nspecialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me.\n\nIf it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonable\nto think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back.  Then\nI get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher\nafter he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules,\nwhich have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).\n\nThe problem is, who decides whether that time is \"wasted?\"  You don't seem\nto think it is at all.

Certain algorythms (usually parallel search\nalgorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.\nI have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.  \nHowever, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its \ndesigners would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion \nof such techniques seems credible.\n\nHmmm...

Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never\n   heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?\n\nThis is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to\nmeasure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process\nby which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported\netc.\n\nSee `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison\nWesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of\nsoftware process maturity are:\n\n1. Initial\n2. Repeatable\n3. Defined\n4. Managed\n5. Optimizing\n\nThe levels are approximately characterized as follows:\n\n1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical\n   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will\n   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will\n   be.  Most software production is at this level.\n\n2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project\n   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects\n   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration\n   management and quality assurance.\n\n3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is\n   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a\n   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,\n   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the\n   project.\n\n4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered\n   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this\n   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.\n\n5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts\n   are effective and certified.\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: nagle@netcom.com (John Nagle)\nSubject: Re: FYI - BATF reply on Waco\nOrganization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)\nLines: 8\n\n      The San Francisco Examiner reports that Clinton has issued instructions\nto federal law enforcement that they may not kill or injure anyone to \nresolve the Waco situation.

As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied\nand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.\n\nSome 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly\ndeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.\nTogether with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also\nbeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.\nSome 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives \nof other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central\nAsia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee\nthem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.\n\nOne of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against\nAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the\nArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific\nexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection \nof the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.\n\nWe beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,\nfor the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are\nviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,\nits people are shot. There is persistent negative image of\nAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over \nthe whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the\nUSSR and the United States. \n\nOne of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and\ngenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance\nwhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent \nevents stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on\nAzerbaijan.\n\nIt is a well documented fact that before the conflict there\nwere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the\nissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly\nand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their\nrepresentatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan\nSSR.\n\nWe are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we \nare for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one\nof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic \nRepublic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.\n\nBut all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the\nSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists\nencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000\nYear Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the \nneighboring lands.\n\nThe world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,\nsuffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.\n\nBut what about the lives of seven million human beings?\nIf these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are\nless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their \ncolour of skin or religion, by their residence or other\nattributes?\n\nAll people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers\nfor help and understanding. This is not the first appeal\nof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous\nappeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope\nthat the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda\nwill one day reveal the extent of our suffering and\nstimulate at least as much help and compassion for\nAzerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.\n\n\t\tTHE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO \n                KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES \n                OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR\n\n>   Everyone knows this, even the Turks know this, you know this.

The Armenians are Christians, the\nAzerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved\nby the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict\nlie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which\nwere the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of\nthousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. \n\nRecently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred\nthousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and\nHuman Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims\nat 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole\nthing has now gone entirely too far.\n\n>   Want to know what will bring the story in Armenia to the front\n>   page?

The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians \n78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this \ntime in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the \nplots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. \n\nReport taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992\n\n                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED\n\n     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today \nof a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, \na predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.\n     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed\n1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and \nmassacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered\nmountain passes.\n     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani\nreports of a massacre.\n\n                         Scalping Reported\n     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region\nby helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their\nheads blown off.

I believe all of the\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \n\nIMHO \nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\nthink it deserves some consideration.\n\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\n\nDarrell Evans - No.\n\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\n\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\n\n|> \n|>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\n|> giving\n|> \n|> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\n|> marginal.\n|> \n|> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both\n|> \n|> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.\n|> \n\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\n\n|>      Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors\n|> so\n|> \n|> liberally.

The only reason I do not say definately is he still\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\nprobably will turn into a definately.\n\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\nthe possible votes.\n\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\n\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O.

There is also some money for a\nset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.\n\nBetter news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of\nthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next\nyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.\n\nNow not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made\nfor spending half on DC.\n\nPublic support is STILL critical.

We were  \nhaving intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me  \nif you have seen this before...\n\nShould Christians fight?\n\nLast week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there  \nare such things as \"justifiable wars\". I have started looking into these  \nthings and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all  \nhis questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  \ntack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post  \nsome more info soon.\n\nOur duty to our neighbour:\n\nDo good to all men (Gal 6:10)\nLove our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)\n\nAct the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in  \ntrouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  \nman, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  \npeople harm (even medical corps of the army etc).\n\nChristians are by faith \"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\"  \n(Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \"God rules in the kingdoms of  \nmen\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  \nof those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.\n\nWe are to be \"strangers and pilgrims\" amongst the nations, so we are just  \npassing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  \n(this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We  \nare not supposed to \"strive\" or \"resist evil\" (even \"suffer yourselves to  \nbe defrauded\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  \npreserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  \nGod's kingdom.\n\nOur duty to the state.\n\n\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God  \nthe things which be God's\" (Luke 20:25).\n\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power  \nbut of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth  \nthe power, resisteth the ordinance of God\" (Rom 13:1-2).\n\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether  \nit be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing  \nye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)\n\nThese scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  \ndivine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any  \nordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to  \nit. The reason for this is that we are God's \"bond servants\" and His  \nservice is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col  \n3:22-23 where bondservants were to \"work heartily as unto the Lord\" - so  \nalso we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \"Pressed down, shaken  \ntogether, and running over\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...\n\nIn the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is  \nnot fighting in the battle, but is \"testifying\" to the truth.\n\nWhen we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \"fellow  \ncitizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\", and are no longer  \ninterested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to  \nunions etc as well. Paul tells us to \"lay aside every weight\" that we may  \nrun \"the race that is set before us\", and if we are wise, we will discard  \nany association which would retard our progress - \"Thou therefore endure  \nhardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth  \nhimself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath  \nchosen him to be a soldier\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).\n\nOne of these entanglements he warns about is \"be ye not unequally yoked  \ntogether with unbelievers\". One of the obvious applications of this is  \nmarriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business  \npartnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  \nwith any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case  \nthe army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as  \nthem being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one  \nunclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18  \n- I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of  \nservitude, and Jesus says \"take my yoke upon you\", so we are then yoked  \nwith Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen  \nthat we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \"become not ye the  \nbondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).\n\nAn example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2  \n\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\". The situation here is a good  \nexample of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.  \nJehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts:\n1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \"sold himself to work  \nwickedness before the Lord\" (1 Kings 21:25).\n2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said  \n\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal  \nyoking.\n3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  \non hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he  \nfound that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil  \nassociation he had made.\n\nGod says to us \"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not  \nthe unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  \ndaughters\" (2 Cor 6:17).\n\nThis is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into  \nit, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair  \nyet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:\n\nThe Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential  \nfactor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).\n\nTotal dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).\n\nDisobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  \nfollowers (1 Pet 2:7-8).\n\nWe are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant  \nrelationship (Rom 6:12,16).\n\nNo man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).\n\nAll that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1  \nJohn 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in  \nnature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is  \nour master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  \nwas not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  \nmaster.\n\nStrangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to  \nanyone but God.\n\nThe servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -  \nthis does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout  \nour lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor  \n10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).\n\nI'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit  \nfurther.\n\n--\nGideon King                         | Phone +64-3-479 8347\nUniversity of Otago                 | Fax   +64-3-479 8529\nDepartment of Computer Science      | e-mail gideon@farli.otago.ac.nz\nP.O.

During the course of evening I asked \n Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and \n the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, \n I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of \n those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins.\" \n\np. 202 (first and second paragraphs).\n\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \n scattered bones of the dead.\" \n\np. 15 (second paragraph).\n\n\"The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages \n and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of \n their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley \n to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following \n the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt \n desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. \n Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.\"\n\n\"I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while \n holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and\n treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all\n Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving\n a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified\n an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.\"\n\np. 20 (second paragraph).\n\n\"Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar\n section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors\n were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great \n fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they\n smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last\n Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,\n unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and\n the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished.\"\n\np. 109 (second paragraph).\n\n\"As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative\n experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself\n incompetent to rule by legitimate means.\n\n The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and\n outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing\n body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to \n do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their \n fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.\n\n The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,\n as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking\n the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and\n condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method \n of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the\n condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back\n of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of\n those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became\n a common way of paying debts.\"\n\np. 203 (first paragraph).\n\n\"A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the\n point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock \n and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him\n sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising\n it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!\n Slodkey!' (Sweet.)\"\n\np. 203 (second paragraph).\n\n\"One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the \n ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about\n it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.\n The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed\n sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and\n other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the\n dead.\"\n\np. 204 (first paragraph).\n\n\"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her\n throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\n year old.\"\n\np. 118.\n\n\"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\n\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\n\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\n and completely destroyed.\"\n\np. 192.\n\n\"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced....

(First and second paragraphs)\n\n\"Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians \n did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, \n the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace \n actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.\n\n I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,\n in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest.

Using this line of reasoning, the\ngovernment shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and\nwhat encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting\none's freedom of speech.

As I recall, if I exited\nfrom a DOS session while in full-screen mode, the menu titles had changed to a\nscrambled version of the icon title font (or something like that).
