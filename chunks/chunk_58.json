Elizabeth Bartley) writes:\n\n>I can certainly see opposing the \"Amen\" -- but that doesn't require \n>opposing a moment of silence.\n\nI already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause\nme to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a \"moment of\nsilence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\n\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\nthis \"moment of silence\" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\nChristian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \nbeing able taking note of it.)\n\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\n\"mainstream\" religion.\n\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\ndoesn't NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\n\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\non non-Christians.\n\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\"\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\nthe world to do so.\n\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\nsilence in school.

I received 20\nresponses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made it\npossible.\n\nOn my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase\nand Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application\nthat can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL\nstring and receive the results.\n\nMost people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other \nproducts mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,\nRBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.\n\nFor myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C\nportability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the\nsource code, and portability is important in my application. It works\nwith DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.\n\nHowever, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising.\nIt's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and\nformatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp,\nexcept it's effectively unusuable without two manuals:\nthe \"ODBC Programmer's Reference\" and the \"ODBC SDK Guide\". Moreover,\nODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's \nup to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,\nit's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK). \nNevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should\nmake life interesting in the future.\n\nHere's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by \na line of asterisks (*).\n\n> Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have libraries for accessing\n> their respective databases (Paradox, FoxPro) from within C programs?\n> I'd really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pass it\n> to a function which returns the query results in some format.

It consists of a rather broad\nlibrary of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal (I think\nturbo Pascal 5.5 and up) and C (I think either Microsoft or Borland).\n\nNow.. reading the box... it's \"Borland Paradox Engine & Database\nFrameworks\".

The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\nbad judgement call.\n\n\n>#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\n> He\n>is very unlikely to be back next season.\n\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\nhustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\nretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\nnow is the Gulls.\n\n>#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\n>Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\n>Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\n>I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n>14 games he played this season.\n\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\nfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he\nwas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.\n\n> He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.\n\nAgreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you\nwish they'd performed than how they actually performed.

British promised to Venizelos\n(greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be\ngiven to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of\nthe British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman).\nThe British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few,\nforcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate\nstates (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous\ndivision between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the\n\"Allies\" gave any green light because they liked us....)\n\nAnyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second\nfront against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war\nin the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end.\nAfter that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises\n(as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek\ncause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual\n\"reasoning\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually\nbackup Kemal (who had given now to the British \"water and bread\" that\nhe will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small\nethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan\nto keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion\ninto warm-water facilities. The \"greek empire\" being an Orthodox Christian\nstate was too prone to become Russian client.\n\nOut of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our\nlands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \"Giants\" by the\nBritish, since they worked to realize their goals in the region.\nUnder the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big\nmilitary funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian\nbuffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because\notherwise the use of terror of changing \"the balance of power in the Aegean\"\nwill be used.\n\nUnder the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.\n\nGr\n\nPS: I don't make any anti-...whatever rhetoric.

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

Just as we have seen in the past with\n\"blue box\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,\nwe can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for\nstolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes\ncriminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen\ninstruments.\n\nBecause a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,\na stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.

If we are going to get anywhere in \nthis (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never \naddressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is \n\"right\" or who is \"wrong\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover \nand that, having been placed \"in between\" the Israelis and the guerillas,\nthey *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.\n \n\t[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms \n\tis *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that \n\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as\n\t\"combatants\". So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \n\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \n\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \n\tlike civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \n\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\n\tthat will come to civilians.*\n\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\nthe risk to civilians.\n\n\tBut if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves\n\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \n\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \n\tcover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \n\tview, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \n\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\n\n> If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working?

I have always thought that Israel's bombing\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \n\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \non the civilians caught in their path.  \n>\n>|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \n>|> can start all over again?

By your\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\n\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DO\nNOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \n\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \nIf you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians \nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?\nSince they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\".

NO, what is being\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\nfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\nis totally irrelevent.

Since we have to trust the escrow companies\nanyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from\nrandom seeds entered by the escrow agents.

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and\nOberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a\nspot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,\nthe detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the\nfour sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of\nthe crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional\nto the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII\ngraphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)\n\n\n\n              -------------------------> 1\n             |                       |\n             |                       |       |\\\n           -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\n           XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\n           XXXXX|                            |      \\        -------\n    light >XXXXX|                            |        \\_____ divider __ output\n           XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------\n           XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |\n           XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2\n           XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /\n           XXXXX|         \\ /        |       |/\n           XXXXX| anode              |\n           XXXXX                     |\n           ----- cathode 2           |\n             |                       |\n             |                       |\n             --------------------------> 2\n\nIf the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position\nof the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-\ntion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).

If players' performance was completely random\nin (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be\ngood in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.\nWith two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each\nyear, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.\nWe have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd\nexpect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.\nThis is what we actually get--\n\nNo. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5\nClutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3\nCoin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3\n\nEssentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years\nof good performance is the same as what you would get if the process\nleading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.\nIf there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)\nthat had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of\nplayers at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping\na coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\nIn the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\nreally horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, \nyou'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  \n\nEverything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period\nof years that could be used to predict any ability with any \nproposed definition has looked like a random process (with the \ncaveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage\nthat could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein \nprobably never had a \"clutch\" AB against a left-handed pitcher,\nbut he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would\nbe a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his \nplatoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced\nat casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into \nstudying it and every one of them, with the exception of the\nElias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow\nyou to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better\nthan flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the\nflaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-\ncoming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.

This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's\ncoercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone.\n\nI will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.\nThe original title perhaps should have been \"Distinction between legal\nand illegal cipher systems considered harmful\", but \"Clipper considered\nharmful\" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n  1.  Clipper is made available.\n\n  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal\n      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\n      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\n      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper\n      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such\n      detection a cause for further action.\n\n  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be\n      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum\n      some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and\n      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.\n      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a\n      red flag.\n\n  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper\n      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof\n      and much less spoofable than today's cellphones.\n\n  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not\n      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper\n      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that\n      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably\n      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the\n      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because\n      each one has a unique unit key.\n\n  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they\n      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because\n      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be\n      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly\n      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise\n      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under\n      immediate suspicion.\n\n  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,\n      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.\n\nBy #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper\nphone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one's\nassociation to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips\naround, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is\nassociated with someone else.\n\nA non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure\ncommunications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,\nor steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from\nreporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted\ncommunications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,\nbut the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying\nor abandoning the phone before T elapses.\n\nIt would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper\nphone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone\nelse's bill, and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion.\n\nThis leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion\nand collusion.\n\nCoercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes\na low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from\na car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen\nfrom someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to\narise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor\ncriminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone\nwho is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected\ncommunication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.\nThe limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means\nthat continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of\nfreshly coerced phones.\n\nThere would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively\nwealthy criminals, and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money,\nand who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper\nphone service for someone else's use.\n\nCriminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a\nClipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal\ncellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to\ntheir stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone's use being coerced must\nfirst be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and\nhave its keys obtained from escrow.\n\nClipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to\nconceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance\nmechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,\ncan validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal\nin realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,\nwhich we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate\npieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.\n\nWhereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium\nwould stand out, a criminal's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper\nmedium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk\nrecordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper\nchip is fractured.\n\nIf you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge\nthe criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be\nusing someone else's phone), but you'll have no evidence to help you against\nwhatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be\nable to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you\nidentify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.\n\nThe gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than\nthey were before Clipper came along.\n\nI therefore consider Clipper harmful because:\n\n  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against\n      aggressive or dishonest government.\n\n  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct\n      criminal threat to the honest public.\n\n  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to\n      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than\n      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring\n      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.\n\n  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors\n      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime\n      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key\n      escrow is claimed to help against.\n\n  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting\n      of \"illegal\" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher\n      machine...\n\nBrad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet, pyramid}!optilink!brad\nPetaluma, CA\n"}, {"text": "From:  (Rashid)\nSubject: Re: Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\nNntp-Posting-Host: 47.252.4.186\nOrganization: NH\nLines: 126\n\nIn article <1993Apr22.132909.5001@nic.csu.net>,\ndavec@silicon.csci.csusb.edu (Dave Choweller) wrote:\n> \n> In article <1993Apr22.004405.28052@bnr.ca> (Rashid) writes:\n> [stuff deleted...]\n> >The point of my post was that Rushdie was not being condemned solely\n> >for the \"words\" in his book (although this was certainly a contributing\n> >factor).

To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour\n> against Rushdie?\n\nOnce the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on\nthe matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes\nshowing\nthe dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so\nnewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there\nwould\nappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how\ndramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the\nsituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued\nthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central\nspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's\nright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\n\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \nwas annoying.)\n\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\n\"organized\"\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a \"secular\" Islam - an Islam\nseparated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\nmade\nhis views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\ntime,\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\nindividuals.\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\nengaged\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\n\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\n\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\nkind, has no\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in \"boldly\"\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\na kind of secular \"heroic Knight\",mounted on the his media steed,\n doing battle with the \"dragon\" of Islamic \"fundamentalism\".\n\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, \nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\nwho, when\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\n\n>You're attempts at justification are not doing the\n> image of Islam any good.\n\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. \"Image\" is\nthe chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\nwould then be thought to have a good \"image\" (Principally because it would\nby and large reflect the secular image). A \"good image\" usually means \" be\nmore\nlike me\".\n\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\nthat\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.\n\n>  In Iran, the situation was monitored for many\n> >months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free\n> >worldwide voice that the media gave him, the situation was monitored\n> >more seriously.

If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much in\nthe\nmedia, the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed, no\nfatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away.\n"}, {"text": "Subject: Re: Albert Sabin\nFrom: rfox@charlie.usd.edu (Rich Fox, Univ of South Dakota)\nReply-To: rfox@charlie.usd.edu\n <1993Apr7.073926.9874@engage.pko.dec.com> \n <1993Apr10.213547.17644@rambo.atlanta.dg.com> \n <1993Apr11.162936.18734@zeus.franklin.edu>,<1993Apr15.225657.17804@rambo.atlanta.dg.com>\nOrganization: The University of South Dakota Computer Science Dept.\nNntp-Posting-Host: charlie\nLines: 71\n\nIn article <1993Apr15.225657.17804@rambo.atlanta.dg.com>, wpr@atlanta.dg.com (Bill Rawlins) writes:\n>|> >|> \n>|> However, one highly biased account (as well as possibly internally \n>|> inconsistent) written over 2 mellenia ago, in a dead language, by fanatic\n>|> devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more \n>|> objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those who's messiah this creature \n>|> was supposed to be, doesn't convince me in the slightest, especially when many\n>|> of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of \n>|> guano...\n>\n>       Since you have referred to the Messiah, I assume you are referring\n>        to the New Testament.

By biblical scholar I mean\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\n\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\n\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\nhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\nbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\nfaith off as fact.\n\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? \nShouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \nan evolutionary ancestry).\n\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \n\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\nresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \ncontain the first four.  \n\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\n\nIts faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. \nWhatever works for you.

I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.\n\tThe official side has its advocates already; lets balance the\n\tequation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake\n\tof an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:\n\n\t\tinnocent until proven guilty.\n\tnot\n\t\tinnocent until presumed guilty.\n\n\t1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.\n\n\t\tDon't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard\n\t\tequipment.\n\n\t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\n\n\t\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This\n\t\t  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable\n\t\t  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.\n\n\t\t\t.... gotcha!\n\n\t\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.\n\n\t\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote\n\t\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,\n\t\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\n\t\t  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?\n\n\t\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\n\t\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\n\t\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\n\t\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\n\t\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\n\t\t  to ignite.\n\n\t\t\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics?\n\t\t\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?\n\n\t\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\n\t\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\n\t\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\n\t\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\n\t\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\n\t\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\n\n\t\t\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes.\n\t\t\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\n\t\t\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\n\t\t\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open\n\t\t\tto the outside?).\n\n\t\t\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\n\t\t\tcompound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones\n\t\t\tare missing?\n\n\tDo I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.\n\tYou trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?\n\t\tIN advance of a Court?  God help us.\n\t\t\t(For we are surely not helping ourselves).\n\tYou trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?\n\n\t\tYou are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.\n\t\tLook again.\n\n\tDid it happen that way?  I do not know.
