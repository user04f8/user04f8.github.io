But \n>the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens\n>hasn't.\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\nthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n>Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement\n>is totally meaningless.

They performed well in two short series and won the\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\n\nSeriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\nand why? Did Morris somehow \"learn how to win\" in the intervening ten years?\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\na run lower than 1992?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nDon't be humble, you're not that great.\n"}, {"text": "From: gkoh@athena.mit.edu (Glenn Koh)\nSubject: Re: Gateway 4DX-33V - too high a price?\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLines: 9\nNNTP-Posting-Host: w20-575-74.mit.edu\n\n\nThen again, maybe $2445 for the gateway system isn't too cheap.\n\nI have a system from Micron computers:\n\n486-2-50, 16 meg ram, 245 Maxtor HD, Local bus IDE / 2 meg video card, and\nthe same 15\" monitor.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\nwould call Japan, etc.\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\nlike memory is that expensive any more.

An EFF Statement\nX-Xxmessage-Id: <A7F49385AC03AC80@harding.eff.org>\nX-Xxdate: Fri, 16 Apr 93 21:47:01 GMT\nNntp-Posting-Host: harding.eff.org\nOrganization: Electronic Frontier Foundation\nX-Useragent: Nuntius v1.1.1d17\nLines: 122\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 16, 1993\n\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\n\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\n\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\nstore users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\nincorporation into its communications products.\n\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\nanswer.\n\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\ndiscussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\n\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\nmade public.\n\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\n\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\n\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\nDaniel J.

GANDLER) writes:\n>\n>\tHow does the radio Electronics free information cards work.\n>Do they just send you some general information about the companies that\n>advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a\n>catalog. \n\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\ndata on computer disk.\n\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\n\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.\n\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\nthe serious potential customers.\n\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\n\nWhat's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\n\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\n  weeks later.\n\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\n  on a computer printout.\n\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\n\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.\n  Advertisers almost never call. \n\nJohn Schuch\n  publisher of: The Arizona High-Tech Times\n                The Arizona Electrical Journal\n                The Arizona HVAC News\n  (all of which have bingo cards)\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: morrow@cns.ucalgary.ca (Bill Morrow)\nSubject: Need source for old Radio Shack stereo amp chip\nNntp-Posting-Host: cns9.cns.ucalgary.ca\nOrganization: University of Calgary\nLines: 13\n\nLast week I asked for help in getting an old homemade amp working with\nmy Sun CD-ROM drive.

I realize it is \n> normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what\n> are the other reasons?\n\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\nascribes this more broadly.\n\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\nthis way by a critical reader.\n\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\nit bit him on the keister twice.\n\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\nauthor's history of whatever.)\n\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\nthe text provide evidence?\n\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\nthan teach history.\n\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's \"Historian's Fallacies\"\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\nto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy\nto read.  Give it a try.\n\nRussell\n\n"}, {"text": "From: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nSubject: Re: Arab leaders and Bosnia\nReply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nDistribution: world\nLines: 79\n\nIn article <1sn5f5INNkh6@MINERVA.CIS.YALE.EDU> pavlovic-milan@yale.edu (Milan Pavlovic) writes:\n\n>>I really disagree with you.

(alveolus?)\n    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done\n    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen\n    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\n\n  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\n    gas per unit volume. \n\n  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs\nor interfere with their healing or anything like that... \n\n--\nWim Lewis, wiml@u.washington.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: louray@seas.gwu.edu (Michael Panayiotakis)\nSubject: Re: MS-Windows access for the blind?\nOrganization: George Washington University\nLines: 36\n\nIn article <mtrottie.64.0@emr1.emr.ca> mtrottie@emr1.emr.ca (Marc Trottier) writes:\n>In article <1993Apr22.172514.13025@cci632.cci.com> jfb@cci632.cci.com (John Bruno) writes:\n>>From: jfb@cci632.cci.com (John Bruno)\n>>Subject: MS-Windows access for the blind?\n>>Date: Thu, 22 Apr 1993 17:25:14 GMT\n>>We are developing an MS-Windows based product that uses a full screen window\n>>to display ~24 rows of textual data.

In their names we demand justice.\n\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\n\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \nTurkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as \n\"rebels\".\n\nTurkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population\nfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.\n\nTurkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims \nArmenians were a \"threat\".\n\nIn a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of \napproximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.\n\nToday, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The\nsuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish\npopulation.\n\nThe Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and\nproperty lost as a result of this genocide.\n\nARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR\n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\nS.D.P.A.

My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.

Drugs are very illegal and they're\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\nheavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.\n\n>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:\n>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!\n\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.

The\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\nirrelevent.\n\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\n\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\n\n>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them\n>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,\n>it's the 'axer' ??\n>(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)\n\n\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got\nmore knives or fists.  \n\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\nare doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is \nviolent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\nyou can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\n\n>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect\n>themselves.

Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\nwon't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\n\n       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If\nyou're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\nsimply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\n\n>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have\n>guns) what do you think will happen ??

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\n\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\n\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.\")\n\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That's really sad if\n> it is, because I fail to see how it's less than completely sensible.\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it, for whatever\n> inexplicable reasons.\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\n\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n> You'd like Posner, Bill.

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.\n\nOK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They\nneed a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they\nnow need to \n\n   (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of\n       the key.\n\nNow, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses?\nPosession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State\nand lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,\nwhile potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,\nstatutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately\nclever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying\nnew phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen\nones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting\nwithout a dialing license?]\n\nThere's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, \nhow will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough\nsafeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and \nit might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, \nhow is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type\nchip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal\nGovernment, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of\nthe projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of \nthese kinds of problems will be open for public or \"expert\" scrutiny?]  \n\nFurthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, \neven to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be \nan especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a \nkey, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political \nembarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:\n \n   (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and\n       turns the results over to the NY State Police.\n\nBut let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton\nAid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war\ngoing on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.\nNow, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an\nextra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another\nbargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.\n\nI understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain.

My point\nwas that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual\nmarriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage\nbetween two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical\nbasis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to\n\"save themselves\" for such a marriage and to never have sexual\nintercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please\nnote that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be\nwilling to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing\nopinions on the subject.

Ed. 1993\nPre-publication $84.50\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\n\n\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\nreach them.   \n\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\n\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\nfictional\n\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\ncontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare\nillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and\ndrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and\nobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA\narchives\n\nAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)\nPart II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)\nPart III The Experimenters (1900-1938)\nPart IV The World War (1939-1945)\nPart V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)\nPart VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)\n\nABOUT RON MILLER\n\n[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the high\nspots.]\n\nFormer art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian's\nNational Air and Space Museum\n\nMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of\nInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British\nInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space\nSmithsonian* magazine\n\nAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since\n1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and\nmany others, as well as many articles and papers\n\nBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers \n\nContributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*\n\nProduction illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*\n\nDesigner of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for\nU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)\n\nORDERING INFORMATION\n\nPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993\nAfterwards, price will be $112.50\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nPO Box 9542\nMelbourne, FL 32902-9542\nUSA\nDirect order line (407)727-7270\nFax (407)951-3671\n\nAdd $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each\nadditional book.  \n\nFor foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each\nadditional.

Fante} \\endauthor\n\\date {April 20, 1993} \\enddate\n\\endtopmatter\n\nIn a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me to\npull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.''  The 51 day\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\nassigning blame.\n\n\\\n\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\n{\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\n[Reno's] decision.''\n\n\\\n\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\nto show their might and just purpose.\n\n\\\n\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\n\n\\\n\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\n\n\\\n\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\nBranch Davidians.\n\n\\\n\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\nand a city block razed.\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\it This policy of no-knock\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures''] are not denied.\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\noindent Matthew L.
