There is only one way of determin-\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\nsolutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\n\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\nindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\n\n>The fact is that Morris didn't \"win\" any ballgames, Toronto did, in\n>spite of Morris' \"contribution\".   This has been explained to you\n\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\n\n>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.\n\nYou don't have to be rude.\n\n>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.\n\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\nindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of\ncomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-\nformance.\n\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.

Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \nno idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I \nknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine's doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\nIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\".\n"}, {"text": "From: hades@coos.dartmouth.edu (Brian V.

The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and\nmake it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just\nfine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are\ngenerally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.\n\n-Hades\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: cph@dmu.ac.uk (Chris Hand)\nSubject: Cheap LCD panels & seeking info\nOrganization: De Montfort University, Leicester, UK.\nLines: 37\n\nAttention hardware hackers and bargain seekers!\n\nI just bought a 640x200 pixel LCD panel for 25 UK pounds.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?\n\n\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window \nor the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. \nThe file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr \nclient and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\n\t\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \ncommand-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for \nspecifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\n\n\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of \narbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.\nThere are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]\nis the most recent.\n\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders \nXPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;\nsee xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\n\tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr\nis available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: \nsoft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\n\txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available\nfrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\n\n\tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,\nwhich is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps\nand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for \nuse in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and\ncontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\n\n\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\nsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\n\n\tAlso: \n\n\tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter \n2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net\nin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\n\n\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-\ncapture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and \nnon-PostScript printers.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) \ninclude session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portion\nof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which \ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \nhave a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \nsupport for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package \nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\n\n\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \n\t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \n\t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \ndistribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\n\n\tThis can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider \ninstead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\n\n\tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ \nPortable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting \namong various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\n\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in \nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\nIt's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\n\n\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \nGraeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\n\n\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\n\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\n\n\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\n\n\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \nto PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, \nweedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\n\n\tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential \ninteractive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is \na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\n\n\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \nexport's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\n\n\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\nas part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]\nxtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.\n\n\tA version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool\nis available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package \nalso includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version\nof the control sequences. [1/93]\n\nOther good sources of information include the R4 version of that document\nand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a \ncompilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 \nsequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was \npublished in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).\n\nIn a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.\n\n[last updated 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?\n\n\tIn order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to \n\"stty pass8\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as \n\tXTerm*font: \t-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n\tXTerm*boldfont:\t-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]\n\nIn addition, you may want to set this in your shell:\n\tsetenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1\n\n        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with \nthe Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using\n`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') \nis Alt-'. \n\n[thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea \n(gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?\n\n\tYou are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give \na resource specification like this:\n\t\txterm*geometry: 80x24\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \nBut its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\n\t\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\n\n\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \n\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\n\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\nadapted to do this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\n\n\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\n\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also \nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \nXtResolvePathname()):\n\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\n                application's class name.\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n        %t      The territory part of the display's language string\n        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string\n\n\tLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\n\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\n\tLet's consider another example. This time, let's set \nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\n\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \nMyterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\n%S are useless.\n\n\tWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization \nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\n\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\n\n\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\nthis batch of default settings.)\n\n\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory \nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\n\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \nby a slash.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\n\nThe answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \n\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \n\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a \ngeneral hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.\n\n[Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?\n\n\tWhen xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login\nfiles. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;\nor you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and\nsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,\nif you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your \n.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting\nyour .xsession file off with \"#!/bin/csh\". \n\tIf this doesn't work, also try starting off with:\n\t\t#!/bin/sh\n\t\t# Reset path:\n\t\tPATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?\n\n\tThere are several ways to avoid having to do a \"setenv DISPLAY ...\"\nwhenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.\n\tOne solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It \nincludes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and\nxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.\nA more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\n\tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse\n(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from\n132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and\n$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then \npropagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\n\t\teval `xrlogind`\nwhere xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special \nformat it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to \nrecreate the environment variables. [11/90]\n\n\tIn addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on \nanother host, and you find\n\t\trsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY \ntoo simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh \ncan be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be \n\t\txrsh <HOST> xterm\n\n  #! /bin/sh\n  # start an X11 process on another host\n  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT\n  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>\n  # rsh $host -n \"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\"\n  #\n  # An improved version:\n  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)\n  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)\n  #\n  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X \nJournal for more information.\n\tThe R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained \na number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format\nand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.\n\tAn easier way is to use the \"xfed\" client to modify an existing font; a\nversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is \navailable for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], \npossibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce\nBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.\n\tThe xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,\nXPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in\n/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed \n[5/91] in export:/contrib. \n\tIf you are a MetaFont user you can use \"mftobdf\" from the SeeTeX\ndistribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution\nis on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\tThe GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,\na font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.\n\tThe O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these\ntools to modify a font.\n\tFonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is\nin ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?\n\n\tAfter you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, \ninstalled it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent\n(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp \n$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the \ndirectory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in\nthat directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably \nleaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \nthe path.)\n\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\n\t\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\n\t\t\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\n\t\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\n\n\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\n\n-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file\n   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\n\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can't find\n   it, run bldfamily(1).)\n\n-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a\n   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for\n   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.\n   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for\n   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work\n   for X11Rn.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones \n(oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  40)  How do I convert a \".snf\" font back to \".bdf\" font?\n\n\tA tool called \"snftobdf 1.4\" is part of the bdftools package, which is \navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from \ncrl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?\n\n\tder Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and \nproduces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be \nused as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can \nunderstand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools \nsuch as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail \nfrom mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]\n\tIn addition, the R5 program \"fstobdf\" can produce bdf for any font that\nthe R5 server has access to.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,\nbut rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to\nstandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file \ncontrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is \nfor a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for \ncreating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers \nwhich do not use the MIT font scheme.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  43)  How do I add \".bdf\" fonts to my DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \".pcf\" format.\nYou can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc\nfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a\nperformance hit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)\nI want to be able to do something like this:\n\txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\n\n\tYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the \nsame depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because \nof this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since \nthere is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, \nneither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap \nconverter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a \nresource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for \nuse in many of its widgets, however.\n[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]\n\nHowever:\n\tA specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of \nthe xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick \n(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of \nimage formats as a pixmap.\n\n\tThe leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used \nby Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by\nAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM \ndistribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write \nroutines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to\nallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information\non the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is\navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on \nthe R5 contrib tape.

Only the first item works.\n\n\tYou probably have an extra space after the specification of the first \nitem, like this:\n\tbasic*text.translations:  #override \\\n\tCtrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\n\\ \t\n\tCtrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()\n\t\t\t\t\t      ^ extra space\nThe newline after that space is ending the translation definition.\n[Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?\n\n\tOne solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show\nthe time for timezones other than the local one. \n\tAlternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from\nwhich you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\tTZ=PST8PDT xclock -name \"San_Luis_Obispo_CA\" 2> /dev/null &\n\tTZ=EST5EDT xclock -name \"King_Of_Prussia_PA\" 2> /dev/null &\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?\n\n\tThe xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system,\nwhich is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list \nof various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in \nthe monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.\nIf you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list, \nyou can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh, \nby sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request\n\"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq\".\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server?\nAfter a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no\nother clients are able to connect to it.\n\n\tThe default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least)\ndelete \"old\" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which \ncontains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add \"! -type s\" to\nthe find exclusion in the cron job.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen?\n\nThe R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens, sorry.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  50)!

I wrote that human brains \"are\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\n\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\n\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\n\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\nconscience is properly formed?\n\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\nthat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll\ngrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.\n\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\n`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\n\n\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\n\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\n\nThe Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\n\nYou write:\n\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\n> not subject to the experimental method. \n\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\nfrom `confident'.\n\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\n\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\nidea of his own fallibility.\n\n\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's\nunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\nconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\nand I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's\nsome chance I'm wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\ncertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\nway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\ndifficult to respond to.

Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list\nignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior\nservice personnel.\n   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),\nsuggested \"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve\ncomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level of\nparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\"\n   He asked the commission \"to remove from consideration all\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\nwarrant approval of the requested action.\"\n   \"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\nimpact on the community, if closed,\" wrote Hultman.  \"The major\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\npercentage of the existing locations.\"\n   Hultman reminded the commission, \"The fact that the vast\nmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\nprocess certainly supports the thesis\" that these actions are\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and\nMarine Corps Reserve.\n   ROA also noted \"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of\nNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480\nNaval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are\napproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\"\n   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging\nfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval\nReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to\nMissoula and Great Falls.

Perlman) writes:\n>>\n>>In a word:  utter and complete horse puckey.  Look the term up in the\n>>dictionary.\n>\n\nOK. Lets look into this.\nAccording to my dictionary,\nZi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish\nnational or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of\nmodern Israel.\n\nNow, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious \nprinciples, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural\nidentities.\n\nSo. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point\nis what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important\nto distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually\ndoing.\n\n1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of\nReturn, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my\nfamily was expelled about 2000 years ago?\n2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?\n3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been \nexpelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I \napply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I \napply as someone whose mother is Jewish?\n4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?\n5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted\nto loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?\n6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in\nIsrael, how do I do it?\n7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to\nIsrael, to convert to Islam?\n\n\nNow, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country\ndo not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.\nSuppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place \nwhich now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as\nwell as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.\nNow suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the\nfighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among \npeople he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same\ngod. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. \nAnd, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created\nwhere my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.\nAnd, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And\nthat people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and\ngranted full-citizenship.\nShould I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as\n20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and\nask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000\nyears?\n\nThen, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.\nI am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in \nZionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.\nHow would those who are Zionist define a Jew? \n\n\n\n\n>\n>>     Eric S.

At this point,  many\ncongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,\nfor a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best\npossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his\nposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,\nCongressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long\nrecord of support and interest in space development, and helped\npass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements\nAct.                      \n        There is a small group of activists in southern California \nwho have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.\nWe are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown\nabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space\nconstituents to let him know that they care about getting\nAmerica back to the Moon.\n        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert \nfor space activists to call or write George Brown to have him\nintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late\nspring, 1993.\n        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's\noffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.\n        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support\nthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\nby necessity, must choose.                    \n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\nof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\ncongressperson's staff review a bill.\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\nwritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists\nand politicians.\n        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please\nrequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service\naddress), or contact your local chapter of the National Space\nSociety).\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n"}, {"text": "From: pharvey@quack.kfu.com (Paul Harvey)\nSubject: The Magi of Matthew was The Jewish Discomfort With Jesus\nOrganization: The Duck Pond public unix: +1 408 249 9630, log in as 'guest'.\nLines: 238\n\nIn article <1746.2BD37A66@paranet.FIDONET.ORG> \nBill.Carlson@p0.f18.n104.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Bill Carlson) writes:\n> Since everywhere I look, Zoroaster is suggested as being a probable\n> descendant of Daniel; suppose you prove he wasn't.\n\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\n\nMAGI: \n\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\n\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \n(Gershevitch, 1964).\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\nhierarchy.\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\nof Central Asia.\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\nthat of the priesthood: white.\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\nmaster of himself.\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\npriesthood, would be very strange.\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\n\nSAOSHYANT:\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\n[See Frashokereti]\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\nits roots to the same source.\n"}, {"text": "From: wellison@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu\nSubject: Re: electronic odometers\nArticle-I.D.: kuhub.1993Apr15.153153.49197\nOrganization: University of Kansas Academic Computing Services\nLines: 10\n\nI had the insturment panel go out in my car (a 1990 Lincoln Contenintal) which\nis a digital dash.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and\nthe minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,\nNuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.\n\nApple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except\nperhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC\nslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC\naccelerators.\n\nOne potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will\nneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with\nRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.\n\nApple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs\nwill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC\nand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in\nexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking\nprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen\nmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.\n\nFirst generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed\nCPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.\nThis should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled\nfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which\nI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do\nthis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as\nstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where\nApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup\nis in order.\n\nBy the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,\nPentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor\nfront for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.\nAlso, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all\nthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent\nright now.\n\nOnce anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market\nposition will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially\nif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it\nmight). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome\nbattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not\nguaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of\nseveral.\n\nMark\n"}, {"text": "From: blakey@ug.cs.dal.ca (Jason Blakey)\nSubject: FTP sites anyone?\nNntp-Posting-Host: ug.cs.dal.ca\nOrganization: Math, Stats & CS, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada\nLines: 7\n\n    Hello netters:)  Does anyone out there know any FTP sites for projects,\nplans, etc of an electrical nature?  \n\n-Jason\n-- \n ............................................................................ \n                      Jason Blakey -> blakey@ug.cs.dal.ca \n"}, {"text": "From: powlesla@acs.ucalgary.ca (Jim Powlesland)\nSubject: Re: Why does Illustrator AutoTrace so poorly?\nOrganization: The University of Calgary, Alberta\nLines: 12\nNntp-Posting-Host: acs6.acs.ucalgary.ca\n\n\nI've had pretty good success autotracing line art with Adobe\nStreamline 2.0.

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\n\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\naccelerator.\n\nPaul\n"}, {"text": "From: vwelch@ncsa.uiuc.edu (Von Welch)\nSubject: Re: MOTORCYCLE DETAILING TIP #18\nOrganization: Nat'l Ctr for Supercomp App (NCSA) @ University of Illinois\nLines: 22\n\nIn article <1993Apr15.164644.7348@hemlock.cray.com>, ant@palm21.cray.com (Tony Jones) writes:\n|> \n|> How about someone letting me know MOTORCYCLE DETAILING TIP #19 ?\n|> \n|> The far side of my instrument panel was scuffed when the previous owner\n|> dumped the bike.
