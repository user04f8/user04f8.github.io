Perhaps such pictures will\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood.

It's one\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\n\n       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \nthemselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\nthe evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\npeople jump off buildings.)\n\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn't mean they\nweren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\nkid might.\n\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\nkilled.\n\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\nbusinesses.)\n\n>Studies by the \n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\n\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I\nwill point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\n\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\nit's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

The\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n\n     Q  What federal laws --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\n\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\nwhere they could be protected.\n\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\nmind during those horrendous moments?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\n\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\n\n     Thank you.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\nAnd I do support her.\n\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as\nwell as she could have.\n\n     Thank you.

I have had\n>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.\n>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?\n \nCertainly. Reference follows. \n\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\n\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\n\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\n\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\n\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\n\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\n\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\nduuteranopia:\n\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \n\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\n\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\n\n>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow\n>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour\n>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!\n\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\ncouple of weeks ago.\n\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\nhelp here.)\n\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\nhave the monitor data.\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\nwhite) until it is displayable.\n\n>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is\n>sufficient interest\n\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\n\n--\nChris Lilley\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \nManchester, UK.

The other x\nthree instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form\nan image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the \nresolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different\nbeast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of \nthe craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the \ndifferential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.\nPositional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors\nand errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have\nany independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to\ndetermine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small \ncomponent to the positional error.  \n\nDemonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would \nrequire resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort \ncloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together \nnow: \"Parallax ARc SECond\", a parsec is the distance of an object \nthat demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).\nIf the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to \nhave to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.\n\nThe beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and\nwatches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination\nwhen you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.\n\n-Kevin\n"}, {"text": "From: shellgate!llo@uu4.psi.com (Larry L.

On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\nthe following to the WSJ.\n\n-----\n\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\n\nPreston K. Covey\n\n\n\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \n \n\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\nhere. \n\n\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\ntake the bus?  \n\n\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\n\n\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\nhomes unaccounted.\n\n\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\nsix counts:\n\n\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\ncriminological hogwash.\n\n\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\ncrucially affect the risk. \n\n\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\nthe matter.\n\n\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\ndisregard this issue.\n\n\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \n\n\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\n\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \n\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \n\n\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\n\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\n"}, {"text": "From: kentiler@matt.ksu.ksu.edu (Kent P.

The idea is to replace the broken\nfloppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some\nproblems:\n\nThe internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only\nconnectors for one single hard disk drive.\n\nIf I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each\n(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?\n\nIs the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?\n\nWhat about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor\npacks from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them\ninstalled in the other disk.\n\nThe SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets\nID #1.

I've \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\n\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\nsatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\nslots.\n\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\nsupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \nthe Pacific Rim. \n\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\n\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\n\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \nSiberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\n\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \nspecifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\nnow.\n\nTidbits:\n\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\n\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\nwithin 9 months.\n\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\n\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\npartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don't worry \nbecause we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\nreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.\n\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\n\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\n\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\nhardware.\n\n-- \nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t    \"Find a way or make one.\"\n\t             -attributed to Hannibal\n"}, {"text": "From: xanadu@seanews.akita.com (Dan Scherer)\nSubject: PS/2 Stuff\nOrganization: SEANEWS - Seattle Public Access News + Mail\nLines: 30\n\nMisc.

The second part is \n  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about\n  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in\n  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are\n  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three\n  sections of this document  before posting. \n  \n         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from\n  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory \n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory\n  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as\n  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last\n  part of the group name followed by \"-faq.Z\", e.g the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for\n  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as \n  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end\n  of  the file name when \"getting\" the file, rtfm will automatically \n  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have \n  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to \n  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/\"name\"  in the body text where\n  \"name\" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.\n  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the\n  subject \"help\" for more detailed instructions.   \n\n    \n\n ==================== \n I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)\n ====================\n  \n       Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is \n  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions\n  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve\n  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used\n  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my\n  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a\n  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box\n  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I\n  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to\n  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. \n  P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) \n  \n       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we\n  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the\n  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other\n  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially\n  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read\n  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that\n  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen\n  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has\n  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,\n  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any\n  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself\n  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup\n  news.announce.newusers.\n\n\n HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) \n     \n         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,\n  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists\n  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ\n  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part\n  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are\n  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this\n  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named\n  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by\n  \"-faq\", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is\n  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use\n  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command \n  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the \".Z\" extension when\n   you \"get\" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file\n  before sending it to you. \n  \n         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned\n  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ\n  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to\n  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere\n  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. \n  It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a\n  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please\n  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh\n  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear\n  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong\n  where. \n  \n         To jump to a particular question search for\n  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For\n  example to find \"Where can I FTP Macintosh software?\" search for\n  the string  \"(2.1)\".  To jump to a section instead of a question\n  use a zero for  the question number.\n\n\n WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)\n\n      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of \n  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are\n  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list\n  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup\n  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and \n  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in \n  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list \n  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from\n  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now\n  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently\n  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,\n  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has\n  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of\n  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform\n  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp\n  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim\n  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX\n  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux\n  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at\n  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n\n\n WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)\n  \n      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. \n  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite\n  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask\n  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft\n  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an\n  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their\n  ways of  communicating.  \n  \n      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your\n  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too\n  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering\n  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one\n  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of\n  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a\n  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,\n  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question\n  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered\n  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few\n  network software designers.\n  \n         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. \n  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra\n  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important\n  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. \n  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a\n  catch-all newsgroup.\n  \n         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in\n  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs\n  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications\n  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought\n  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps\n  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. \n  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases\n  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions\n  about non-communications hardware including questions about what\n  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software\n  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and\n  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about\n  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk\n  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.\n  \n         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. \n  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development\n  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit\n  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,\n  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the\n  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer\n  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. \n  \n         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY\n  technical question about an application that actually begins to\n  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent\n  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly\n  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)\n  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.\n    \n         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to\n  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We\n  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to\n  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to\n  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and\n  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is\n  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is\n  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not\n  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.\n  \n         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the\n  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. \n  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more\n  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI\n  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a\n  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place\n  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in\n  comp.sys.mac.\n\n\n 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF\n THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND\n WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?\n\n      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as\n  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to\n  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in\n  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium\n  for answering common questions like this one.\n   \n         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail\n  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it\n  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups\n  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that\n  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the\n  section of this document that answers their question with just the\n  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to\n  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they\n  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.\n\n    \n\n === \n FTP  (2.0) \n ===\n\n WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)\n\n      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,\n  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),\n  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu\n  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several\n  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove\n  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from\n  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was\n  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the\n  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless\n  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document\n  should be available at the above sites.\n  \n       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians \n  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se\n  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in \n  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). \n  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  \n  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). \n  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au\n  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese\n  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n  (130.69.254.254). \n\n         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). \n  This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,\n  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things\n  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material\n  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other\n  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple\n  system software.  Please read the various README documents\n  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're\n  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute\n  material you find here.\n\n\n CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)\n\n      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from\n  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). \n  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH\n  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available\n  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the\n  words \"help\" and \"index\" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your\n  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files\n  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using\n  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a\n  message with just the text \"help\" (no quotes).\n\n\n WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)\n\n      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above\n  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it\n  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject \"help.\" \n  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,\n  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server\n  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi\n  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,\n  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of\n  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as \"archie\"\n  (no password is needed) and type \"prog filename\" to find what\n  you're looking for or type \"help\" for more detailed instructions. \n  For instance you would type \"prog Disinfectant\" to search for a\n  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails\n  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of\n  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with \"prog\n  Disinfectant\", you might try \"prog disi\" instead.  Substring\n  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many\n  erroneous matches add a \".*\\.hqx\" to the end of the substring, e.g.\n  \"prog disi.*\\.hqx\"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in\n  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. \n\n         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE\n  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you\n  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the\n  net where to find a particular piece of software.\n\n\n CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)\n\n      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from\n  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please\n  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about\n  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.\n\n\n WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)\n\n      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to\n  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're\n  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're\n  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format\n  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special\n  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex\n  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure\n  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary\n  protocol.\n  \n         How a file has been translated and compressed for\n  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have\n  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was\n  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file\n  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the\n  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step\n  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary\n  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress\n  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table\n  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs\n  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh\n  files as they are downloaded.\n\n***************************************************************************\nSuffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar \nExtractors\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  \nCompact Pro|         X     X \nPackit     |                           X\nUUTool     |                                                      X \nMacCompress|                                X \nSunTar     |               X     X     X                                X \nBinHex 5.0 |                     X \nBinHex 4.0 |               X \nDiskDoubler|                           X                X \nUnZip      |                                                   X \nDiskCopy   |                                     X \nmacutil    |         X     X           X                X\n***************************************************************************\n\n     A few notes on the decompressors:\n\n      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different\n  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff\n  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,\n  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will\n  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. \n  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt\n  Expander. \n    \n         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller\n  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow\n  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep\n  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous\n  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.\n   \n         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX\n  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)\n  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac\n  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators\n  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also\n  available by anonymous ftp. \n  \n         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to\n  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading\n  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the\n  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be\n  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress\n  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0\n  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an\n  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if\n  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of\n  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the\n  info-mac/unix directory.\n\n     A few notes on the compression formats:\n\n      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file\n  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. \n  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal\n  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications\n  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating\n  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance\n  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.\n  \n      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,\n  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be\n  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of\n  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve\n  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on\n  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. \n  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have\n  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.\n  \n      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above\n  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created\n  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be\n  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some\n  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard\n  designation for self-extracting archives created with their \n  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they \n  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.\n\n\n HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)\n\n      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human\n  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a\n  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to\n  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo\n  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,\n  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. \n  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.\n    \n         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually\n  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer \n  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of \n  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of\n  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. \n  \n         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any \n  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that \n  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by \n  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and \n  login.  Type the word \"binary.\"  Hit return.  Type \"cd\n  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression\" and hit return.  Then\n  \"get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin\"  and hit return.  Of course\n  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt\n  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this\n  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto\n  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will\n  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If\n  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still\n  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make\n  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe\n  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last\n  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals\n  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.\n  \n  \n  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)\n\n       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable\n  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac\n  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.\n  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as\n  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may \n  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement \n  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going \n  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  \n  (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send \n  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering\n  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world \n  of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question\n  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh\n  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a \n  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nTROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)\n================================================================= \n\n         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific\n  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. \n  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking\n  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step\n  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,\n  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system\n  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your\n  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to\n  recommend solutions to you.\n\n IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)\n\n      \"Microsoft Word is crashing\" doesn't say much.  What were you\n  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the\n  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions\n  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. \n  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions\n  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the\n  following steps fix the problem.  For example, \"Sometimes\n  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error.\" is\n  not nearly as helpful as \"QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two\n  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already\n  contain text.\"  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug\n  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the\n  problem and see if it's still there or not.\n\n\n READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)\n\n      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and\n  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the\n  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound\n  familiar.\n\n\n CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)\n\n      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus\n  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and\n  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  \n   \n       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,\n  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file\n  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This\n  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring\n  from original masters will normally fix this.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  \n\n      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file\n  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. \n  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean\n  reinstall. \n  \n         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these\n  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your\n  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the\n  program.  So it's time to\n\n\n ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  \n \n         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem\n  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the\n  cause of a system or application crash:\n  \n     a.\tRun only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do\n     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself\n     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin\n     launching other applications until you find the one that causes \n     the crash.\n     \n     b.\tIf you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're\n     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you \n     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially \n     when performing complicated operations.\n     \n     c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit\n     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile\n     software out there including some from companies that really \n     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  \n     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its \n     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.\n     \n     d.\tBoot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears\n     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove\n     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense\n     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs\n     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the\n     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the\n     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,\n     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have\n     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the\n     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the\n     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the\n     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the\n     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make \n     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.\n\n\n CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)\n\n      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why\n  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the\n  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work\n  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the\n  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.\n\n    \n\n ====================== \n PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)\n ======================\n\n      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a\n  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot\n  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to\n  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's\n  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step\n  program should be performed about every three months. \n\n\n TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)\n\n      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more\n  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a\n  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,\n  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for\n  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've\n  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements\n  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no\n  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several\n  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty \n  the trash.\n\n\n RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)\n\n      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. \n  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension \n  in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an\n  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably\n  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes\n  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. \n  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no\n  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your\n  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. \n\n\n REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)\n\n      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary\n  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It\n  lets the system know what application should be launched when you\n  open a given file and what icons it should display where. \n  Depending on its size each application has one or more\n  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files\n  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become\n  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. \n  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with\n  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than\n  to defeat an incumbent. \n  \n         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments\n  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice\n  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments\n  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only \n  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. \n  \n         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your\n  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. \n  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild\n  the desktop and warning you that \"This could take a few minutes.\" \n  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you\n  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may\n  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.\n   \n          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing\n  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's\n  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the\n  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly\n  corrupt data structures.    \n\n\n ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)\n\n      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950\n  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain\n  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk\n  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this \"parameter\n  RAM\" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset\n  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys\n  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,\n  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the\n  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter\n  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General\n  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.\n   \n         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the \n  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is\n  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this\n  opportunity to reset it anyway.\n\n\n RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) \n\n      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most\n  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the\n  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these\n  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of\n  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough\n  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of\n  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,\n  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and\n  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this\n  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance\n  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.\n  \n         If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically\n  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6\n  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage\n  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set\n  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. \n  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot\n  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility\n  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks\n  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much\n  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,\n  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.\n\n\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)\n\n      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if\n  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. \n  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file\n  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:\n\n    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  \n    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out \n        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.\n    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the \n        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple \n        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be \n        replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or \n        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, \n        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level \n        of the System Folder.\n    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder \n        is  fine.\n    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then \n        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your \n        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, \n        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't \n        need that waste your memory and disk space.\n    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the \n        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System \n        folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you \n        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace \n        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. \n    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.\n    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file \n        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable \n        system overall.\n\n\n     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)\n\n      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that\n  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even\n  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility\n  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System\n  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in\n  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier \n  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com\n  and run it on all your hard disks.\n     \n         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that\n  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid\n  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything\n  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general\n  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's\n  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh\n  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well\n  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. \n  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of\n  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features\n  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.\n   \n         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they\n  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and\n  reformat (4.9).\n\n\n     BACKING UP  (4.8)\n\n      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be\n  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back\n  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies\n  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate\n  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back\n  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three\n  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. \n  \n         A number of programs are available to make backing up\n  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with\n  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup\n  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder\n  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the\n  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup\n  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.\n  \n         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network\n  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should\n  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,\n  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There\n  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD\n  Backup from System 6.  \n\n\n DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)\n\n      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free\n  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the\n  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be\n  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more\n  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several\n  ways to defragment a hard disk.\n  \n         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your\n  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while\n  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.\n   \n         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for\n  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.\n  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag\n  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the\n  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before\n  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO\n  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the\n  net by asking for one. \n\n\n REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)\n\n      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a\n  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't\n  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is\n  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means\n  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even\n  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are\n  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate\n  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3\n  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may\n  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator\n  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not\n  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.\n     \n         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to\n  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. \n  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal\n  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. \n  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with\n  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat\n  your hard disk.\n  \n         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available\n  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like\n  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk\n  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the\n  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition\n  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware\n  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones\n  bundled with your hard disk. \n  \n         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and\n  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter\n  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and\n  data losses are a very good possibility.\n  \n\n\n  Elliotte Rusty Harold         Department of Mathematics\n  elharo@shiva.njit.edu         New Jersey Institute of Technology\n  erh0362@tesla.njit.edu        Newark, NJ 07102\n\n"}, {"text": "From: shenx@helium.gas.uug.arizona.edu (xiangxin shen  )\nSubject: Re: IDE Low Level Format\nOrganization: University of Arizona, Tucson\nLines: 10\n\nIn article <C5H3yL.F66@news.cso.uiuc.edu> mandel@romulus.ehs.uiuc.edu (Hector Mandel) writes:\n>I accidentally tried to low level format my Western Digital Caviar 280 drive.\n>Is there a public domain or shareware utility available that will allow \n>me to fix it?\n>\n>Thanks.\n\nI am no expert on this.

It is not the result of religion, it is the result\n: of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show\n: others of one's rightness.  I assume that God decided to be judge for our\n: sake as much as his own, if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the \n: judge, we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged \n: ourselves.  \n\nI'm not sure I agree with this 100%.  I agree that arrogance is not the result\nof religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if\nyou mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's\nsuperior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person's beliefs.\n\nI need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall\ninto the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area\nI hope you will forgive me.\n\nArrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that\none's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one's\nreligion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied\nbeliefs.\n\nIt is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.\nWere I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow\nwhat I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\ncorrect.  That's not arrogance.  That's unavoidable behavior.\n\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater than\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn't I be obligated to change so\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\n\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\nof one's superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\n\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation in\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\n\"I'm not very smart.  I'm poor.  I'm not good looking.  I'm just a worm in\nthe ground.  I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin, I\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know\nthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,\nI have been so unthankful.  You've given me power to resist the devil.  I\nhave not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said\nnot to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself\nwith humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you've given me, I have been\ncompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your\nlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to\nsave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it\npleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've led.  Lord,\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I'm so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\nhelp me to change.\"\n\n: \n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\n: they don't want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\n: don't have anything to do with them.\n\nFor me, I've often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\nmost comfortable company.\n\nWhen I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don't feel like\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\nmy wrongness, I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\nhumility in private, I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\nin changing from the error of my ways.\n\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\nIt isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\nto improve in one's ability to serve God.  It's easier to cast aside any hope\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creation\nin our lives instead.\n\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\n: over again by the words of others, you'd think we'd either toughen up\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn't make that\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\n: \n\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil's aim is to get us\ninto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-\nless criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with\nhot irons.  The way the devil gets under the Father's skin is by hurting\nthose that the Father loves so much.\n\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n\t We must reach the root of the evil...\n\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n\t from the dreadful deed...\n\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n\t\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n\t\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n\t\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"\n\n\t\t- Susan B.
