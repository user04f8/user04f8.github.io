Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle,\nof the Blues.  They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk,\nand Tuttle's skate came perilously close to cutting (but actually just\nmissed) the jugular.

He just wasn't\ndiagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to\nhave some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just been\nput on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted as\nlong as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between\nreality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they've\nchecked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands\nover and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oven\nten times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie about\nsomething and automatically assume the situation is the same for his\nown life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes,\nbut still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD\nepisode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt\nit slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).  In any event, he\nis alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with the\nGulls (IHL).  \n\n>\n>Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.\n\nAnd Tuttle is no longer with the Blues, but I don't know where he is.\nPossibly in the IHL, but you'd best ask a Blues fan.\n\n-- \nValerie Hammerl \t       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab \nhammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside,\nV085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.  \"I wanted to learn how to \nget that feeling, and the only way was to learn how to skate.\"  P.

If\nOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an\nextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold\nat third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than\nAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\ndouble.)\n\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.

There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.\n\tThe Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense \ncompetition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will \narise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the \nclient machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together, \npartly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).  \n(Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't\nscorn the concept.)\n\tAnyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be \nreleased next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out \ntil '96.\n\tWith luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)\n\nRob\n\n         |------------------------------------------------------------|\n                      \\       rmohns@vax.clarku.edu       /\n               _________\\                               /________\n                          \\         Rob Mohns         /\n               ==================================================\n                    Annoy Rush Limbaugh.

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\nmounting any serious attack.\n\nInjuries:\n\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\n\nRoster Moves:\n\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\nold, 6'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\nup front as well.\n\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\n\nLines:\n\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nActon-Brown\n\nGalley-McGill\nYushkevich-Cronin\nCarkner-Hawgood\nBowen\n\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\n\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\n\nGame Summary:\n\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\n\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\nof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\n\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\naway every rebound.\n\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\n\nThe Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\n\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\n\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\ntripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\nBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\n\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\n\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\n\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\nlittle.\n\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\nperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\n\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\n\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\nequal and preserved the shutout.\n\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\nhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\n\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\n\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\nthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't\nremember that he's tied with.\n\nNext up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\nin Washington would be the official end.\n\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\nthan 5 under in 80).\n\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\ngoal for the team to focus on.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t38 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tEric Lindros\t67 1992-93\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tMark Recchi\t117 1992-93\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t51 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t117\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t79\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t58\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t58\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner\n\n"}, {"text": "From: pgf@space.mit.edu (Peter G.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\n\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\nspiritual explanations. \n\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \n\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\n\n There is no need\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\n: determnined.\n\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\nwill or not? \n\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\n: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.\n\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\nsurvive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\n\n: For an atheist, no\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\n: an event can have value. \n\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \n\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\nfor starters.\n\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\n: establish your values.\n\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\nseverely flawed.\n\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's\nown people.\n\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\nof other nations. \n\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\n\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\n\nIt looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\nof some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\nmeaning. \n\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\ndo not exist. \n\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others'\nexistence.\n\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \n\n: That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\n\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\n\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\ncease to be subjective. \n\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \ninherently subjective. \n\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\nwe don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's\nown and then to get mad at this. \n\nGod must be schizophrenic.\n\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n: weight whatsoever.\n\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter.

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some\n>claim their heart \"skipped\" beats once in a while.\n\nBoth of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed\nface is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular\npulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in\nthe blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are\nsodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,\none can get too much of a good thing.\n\n>Some reacted with headache, \n\nAgain, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased\nheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,\nessentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency\nher, necessarily.\n\n\n>some stomach ache.\n\nWell stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not\nnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting\noccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has\neaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the\nlist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an\nenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly\nache) would be expected.\n\n\n> Some had watery eyes or running nose,\n\n\nThese are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar\nto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious\ncompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible\nsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the\nsymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets\ncan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be\nnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person\nwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration\nand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from\nsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.\n \n> some\n>had itchy skin or rashes. \n\nPeople respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends\nupon what it is about the compound that \"pisses off\" their body.\nPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many\npeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an\nhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,\ncausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an\nallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that\ncontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can\nperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. \n\n>More serious accusations include respiration \n>difficulty \n\nSee above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory\nproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.\n\nand brain damage. \n\nThe area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system\ncontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling\nthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,\nand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.\n\n\n>Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one\n>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food\npoisoning. \n\nAbsolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,\nsay, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus\ntoo much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,\nplus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days\nbefore from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of\nthings.\n\nBut it might be the MSG. \n\n>if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.\n\nIf noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably\nstomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.\n\n\nAnyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their\nresponses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\n\n          Dianne Murray  wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: tzs@stein2.u.washington.edu (Tim Smith)\nSubject: Re: Sick and tired (was Re: Bill Conklin (et al) 's letter)\nArticle-I.D.: shelley.1pqiubINNmht\nDistribution: na\nOrganization: University of Washington School of Law, Class of '95\nLines: 19\nNNTP-Posting-Host: stein2.u.washington.edu\n\nIn article <1993Apr4.054843.22307@mks.com> richw@mks.com (Rich Wales) writes:\n>Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular\n>employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay\n>his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-\n>sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court\n>with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally\n>voluntary?

In California,\nit is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in\nCalifornia is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.

Under\nthe \"War on Drugs\" campaign of \"zero tolerance\" due process protections\nhave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have\nproliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians\nwho favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only\nlegal, but political:  \"My fellow Americans, we must send our young\npeople the message that we are serious about winning the War On\nMurder\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun\nprohibition laws.

You may ask me for anything in my name, and\nI will do it.\" (John 14:12-14)\nSo, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time,\nthe request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other\nbeings, but from Jesus.  Remember that \"there is one God and one\nmediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as\na ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.\" (1\nTimothy 2:5-6.  Also, \"there have been many of those priests [talking\nabout priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from\ncontinuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a\npermanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who\ncome to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.\"\n(Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus\nbeing our mediator rather than any other man.\n\nJoe Fisher\n\n[\"The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right\" may not be as\nobvious as you think.  In what sense to you mean didn't have?\nChristian thought has generally said that they had Jesus in the sense\nthat they were saved by his death.  God is not bound by our\nchronology.  So in some real spiritual sense they did \"have Jesus\".\nEven in terms of knowledge, while they surely didn't have the explicit\nknowledge that we have, Christians have normally seen messianic\nprophecy as knowledge of Jesus, even if knowledge from afar.\n--clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: jessea@u013.me.vp.com (Jesse W.

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \nPlug and Play on every PC.\n\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\nplatform use of the same device.\n\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\n=====================================\n\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \nfee or royalty.\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\n\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \nsynchronization.  \n\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\n\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \nreceiver.  \n\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \nadditional semantics, including checksum.\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \nsystem is running, without rebooting.\n\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\n\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\n\n\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\n------------------------------------------------\nPostal Address:\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\nFax: (408) 991-3773\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\n\n"}, {"text": "From: kurt@oddjob.uchicago.edu (Kurt Henriksen)\nSubject: BRAKE ROTORS...CROSS DRILLING...312 702 8323\nOrganization: University of Chicago, Astronomy and Astrophysics\nDistribution: na\nLines: 1\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: mam@mouse.cmhnet.org (Mike McAngus)\nSubject: Hard/Soft == Strong/Weak.

And then Saturday the President \nwill leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown.  He \nwill spend the day there, overnight at Camp David. \n\t     \n\t     On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave \nCamp David and fly to Boston.  He'll leave from Hagerstown. The press \nplane will leave from Washington. \n\t     \n\t     He will meet with some --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind of a plane is that he's taking?\n\t     \n\t     MS.

So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait \nfor him at the airport.  There is currently no provision -- and I'll \ndouble-check, because there's currently no provision -- I think \nthat's standard operating practice.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get \non the plane at Hagerstown?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What time does he have to be in Boston?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's going to meet there with a group of \ncitizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at \naround 1:30 p.m.  We're still working out the final times.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At the airport?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel.  \n\t     And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group \nthat authored something called Project 21.  The speech to the \npublishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.  It will be followed by Q&A.  And \nthen after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the \npublishers, and then return to Washington from Boston.  And that's it \nfor the weekend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President seen the report from -- or the \nletter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, \nobviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright?  And what is \nhis reaction to their call on him?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to \nSecretary Christopher.  I believe Secretary Christopher received the \nletter on Saturday.  He reviewed it and met with the authors on \nMonday to discuss their views.  He believes it's an important part of \nthe policy-making process and is taking their views into account as \nwe go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the President's reaction?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President hasn't seen the letter.  It \nwas something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.  In \nterms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of \ntheir concerns generally, what the President has said is that there \nare a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't \nthere before.  And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned \nabout the situation in Bosnia.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he influenced by that?  I mean, how does he feel \nabout the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk \nofficers --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Many of the specialists in that area -- I \nthink that that is clearly part of the process.  It's something -- \ntheir views will clearly be considered.  I think Secretary \nChristopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.  I \nthink he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that \nthose opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who \nwork closely on the issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What do you mean, there are options on the table \nthat weren't there before?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President said last week that \nthere were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian \nMuslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being \nconsidered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine \nAlbright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action \nby the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along.  Is that on the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- \nany conversations that would have happened between Ambassador \nAlbright and the President.  But I think the President has said he \nwould certainly -- is working with our European allies.  He's had a \nnumber of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build \nsome consensus there.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything \nspecific to say today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  I mean, in term of there will be no new \nannouncement of policy today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does your statement mean he has ruled out \nunilateral action?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies \nat this point.  He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about \nit, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with \nits allies on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On that point, does he believe that the U.S., \nthough, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already \nto take unilateral action?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes \nit clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian \nrelief effort.  I think the broader point is that anything we do, any \noptions that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is \nconsistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our \nallies to make sure that we get it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as \ndistinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done \nto stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that that's why we're considering \nadditional options.  I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday \nwere quite compelling.  The situation in Bosnia is tragic.  The \nPresident is very concerned about it.  He has -- I think President \nClinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to \nisolate Serbia in the world community.  Clearly, we're considering \nother options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's \nnot enough.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In terms of what you were just talking about, it \nsounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to \nprotect humanitarian --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word \njustify.  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting \nthe delivery of humanitarian relief.  But I think that's just an \nexplanation of the resolution.  I think any action that we take will \nbe consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to \nmake sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The President and other officials have ruled out \nunilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.  You're declining to do \nthat this morning.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I said the President has said repeatedly \nthat he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which \nhas been said before explicitly.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't mean to imply a change in policy.  \nThe President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with \nour allies on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One other little question.  Did he know about this \nletter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  Secretary Christopher \n-- they may have had a private conversation about it.  The President \nhas not seen it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  They met on Monday, right?  Christopher met --\nsurely, he must have brought that up --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they may have talked privately about \nit, but --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright \nrecommendation has been rejected, is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I didn't say that at all.  I said I \nwon't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or \ncommunications.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She's advocating unilateral action and you're \nsaying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine \nAlbright may or may not have recommended.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and \nfrustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, \ndoes the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service \nofficers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to \nthat?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being \nconsidered.  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two \ndays later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing \nof their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater \ndetail the options that they had presented in the letter.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on --\nadditional pressure on him now from within his own administration to \nact regardless of what the allies may or may not do?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there's a broad policy \nreview underway now.  And the President and his advisors are \nconsidering a number of options, including some of those outlined in \nthe letter from the folks over at the State Department.  Now, no \ndecisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a \nthrough review underway, and that their opinions are being very \nseriously considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking \nfor is what was his reaction to this letter?  Did he say, good, this \nbolsters my position?  Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't \nneed right now?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute \nsubstantively to the debate.  It's important that all views be \nconsidered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he \nwants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and \nthis, I think in many ways, furthers that goal.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the \nPresident -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or \nsay that they were out of line?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the fact that Secretary \nChristopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they \nhad an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is \nconclusive evidence that their views are welcome.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the policy review include what Madeleine \nAlbright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, \nwhich is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral \naction -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The unilateral option is on the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've had two different --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't that a change, Dee Dee?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That would be a change of policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which \nhas been specifically ruled out.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.  \nI don't -- that is not --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you talking about all options?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has \nbeen fairly clear about that.  So let me just review again what he \nhas said.  He has said that -- the President has said all options are \non the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground \ntroops, which he has never suggested.  He has ruled that out from the \nbeginning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. \ncan solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself.  I think \nthat there are a number of very complicated options on the table \nright now.  I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on \nspecific options that are being considered other than in the broad \ncategories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms \nembargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked \nabout in broad terms.  This is a very complicated situation.  The \noptions being presented and considered are very complicated.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Air strikes on the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I think that's been fairly clearly \npointed out that that's something that's being discussed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, ground troops are not being considered.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said there was not going to be -- you said you \nwere not announcing a change of policy.  Then you said everything is \non the table.  We're confused.  Are unilateral actions on the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  All I can tell you is what the President has \nsaid -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert \nwith the allies on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they \ndon't go along --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies \non this.  He's continuing to have discussions.  He's continuing to \npress them for further action.  And I think that's clear.  The \nconversation is ongoing.  We're going to continue to work with them \nto find the best possible solution and next step on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to \nconduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite \neffect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel \nthat their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid \nwould become vulnerable and the Bosnians --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I \nmean, I'm not sure who you're referring to.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The British and the French.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, the British and French.  They've taken the \nposition that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized \nby any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military.  Does the \nU.S. believe differently from that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with \nboth Mitterrand and Major, as you know.  I think that there is a \nthorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.  And I \ndon't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions \nother than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as \nwe move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action.  \nAnd I think that process is ongoing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     the other day voted against any military \nintervention yesterday.  Does the President regard that as the end of \nthe line or does he does still hold out some possibility of \nunilateral action?  The allies have been very, very plain that they \ndo not want to do anything.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.  That's all I \ncan tell you at this point.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you saying that there won't be any announcement \non Bosnia today in the press conference?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press \nconference.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the intention?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's an opportunity to take questions.  He \nmay have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, \nbut it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia.  That \nwill not happen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening \nstatement is?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's sort of a general statement of where we \nare.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After the first hundred days, you mean?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's not a long statement.  I mean, this is \njust generally.  Don't look for any major policy pronouncements.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know what the opening statement is?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able \nto tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review.  \nBut the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not \nmeant to be.  It's just to take questions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the \nopening statement is on.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Since the major purpose here is just to take \nquestions, it's not completely resolved yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and \nthat the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, \nwould be an AIDS czar.  Will he announce that today?  And what's the \ndelay on that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think we meant to imply -- I think \nwe said it would happen soon.  I don't think we meant to imply with \nany certainty that it would be this week.  It is coming soon.  I \ndon't anticipate that happening today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the delay?  Isn't this the perfect time to \nannounce an AIDS czar?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that it's a delay.  I think the \nprocess is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through \nthe necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed \nthe t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for \nthe Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?  And why wasn't her \nappointment announced here?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The qualifications -- I don't know if \nthere's a specific list; I'll have to check and see.  I think there \nare a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.  \nMany of them have long histories in intelligence or other government \nservice.  I think there's a broad variety of views across political \nspectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there.  We never \nmade a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, \nwhich is Admiral William Crowe.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why would he appoint her, though, if the American \npeople and many in the Senate rejected her for another government \njob?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that the American people \never had -- voted on her.  And I certainly -- she was never rejected \nin the Senate.  She never went up there for a hearing.  But the \nPresident believes she's a very competent person.  He's said that -- \nZoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?  Zoe Baird is on \nthe President's Foreign Intelligence --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said she never went up there for a hearing?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage \nover violating federal laws?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you \nsaid she was rejected by the Senate.  I was just simply trying to \npoint out that she was never voted on by the Senate.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So you don't think that is any problem?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think there's any problem.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She has been appointed to this board, is that a \nfact?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does she need confirmation for this?  Does she need \nconfirmation to be a member of the --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  It's a presidential appointment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Usually, announcements are made here at the White \nHouse.  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We didn't make an announcement.  People who \nasked were told who  the members of the board were.  We didn't make \nan official announcement.  If anybody's interested in that we can \ncertainly put out the list of names.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'd like to know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a  \nmatter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and \npresidential appointment regardless of their dimension?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Not always.  But, again, I'm happy to put \nthis out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't that the standard practice?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That was past practice.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I'm happy to put it out.  We'll put \nout a list of the members of the board today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get \nout of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is \nhasn't it been the practice in this administration for such \nannouncements to be made routinely?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.  And we're \nhappy to put that out today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the board, what is her title, what is the \nsize of the board?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the \nboard.  It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, \nretired military personnel on the board that provide input into \nintelligence policy for the President.  Again, the chairman of that \nboard is Admiral William Crowe.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And did he recommend Baird?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the name of the board?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, PFIAB.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's her qualification -- that she had employed \nan illegal alien?  Is that -- (laughter) -- \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Do you want an answer to the question or you \njust want to make a joke?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me phrase it another way.  Why shouldn't this \nappointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a \ncouple of months ago?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Because it's not.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's her experience in foreign intelligence?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  She's an experienced attorney, someone who \nthe President believes is very competent and qualified.  And I think \npart of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.  Not \neverybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that \nis not the board's mission.  It is to provide civilian input for the \nPresident as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters.  He \nbelieves she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously \ntalented and has said that throughout.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this just a figment of my overactive \nimagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think so.  On December 24th, when he \nannounced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he \nwould -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board.  So I \ndon't believe there's ever been any --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Earlier than that, during the transition.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't believe so.  It was announced, \nagain, on December 24th.  Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was \nannounced. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are members paid?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so, but I'll double-check.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the \ndiscrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the \nbodies that are coming out of Waco and the state?  I guess it's the \nTexas Ranger reports.  \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the \nfederal information is coming from the site.  Clearly, there's been \nsome discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it.  \nOfficials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day \nbefore yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet \nholes.  I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice \nDepartment is looking into it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the President going to get involved in trying to \nsort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down \nthere, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, \nbut others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of \nthis?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that he's going to try to \nmediate the dispute.  I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything \nhe intends to do about it.  But as you know, there are several levels \nof investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work \ntogether. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there any one agency or official down there in \ncharge of everything?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll have to get back to you \non that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's going to be fairly general.  I don't \nthink it's going to be any specific announcements.  I think it's \ngoing to be sort of a --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're still working on it.  But I wouldn't \nlook for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like \nthat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of \"my \nexcellent adventure for 100 days\"?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Not exactly, but I think he'll take a little \nbit broader look about what's happened in the last --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Foreign, domestic?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  A little bit of both, but I think a lot of \ndomestic.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And overview. \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, more of an overview than a specific \npolicy announcement.  \n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which \nthe President will address the gay rights march on Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be a letter read to the crowd by \nCongresswoman Nancy Pelosi.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that available?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Not yet, but it will be.  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you going to put it out here or --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll probably put it out here on Sunday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Travel next week?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Unclear.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the question?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Likely?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Likely?  Possible?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Possible.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's possible?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Travel.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform \nand national service legislative proposals next week.  Do you have \ndays yet for them?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Not yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us which order?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Campaign finance reform first; national \nservice later in the week.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And any report in the aftermath of the day?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Any readout from the day?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Readout.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Jeff Eller will be down \nthere.  I think he can go through what the President did during the \nday.  We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure \nhere in the morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular \npractice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David.  \nIn fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Twice.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why this weekend?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He went two weekends ago, as you know, on \nthe way home from his father-in-law's funeral.
