Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a\n SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2\n which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.

The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}\n\nSCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while\nIDE itself limits the through put.\n"}, {"text": "From: glang@slee01.srl.ford.com (Gordon Lang)\nSubject: Re: Honors Degrees: Do they mean anything?\nOrganization: Ford Motor Company Research Laboratory\nLines: 27\nNNTP-Posting-Host: slee01.srl.ford.com\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL5\n\nJustin Kibell (jck@catt.citri.edu.au) wrote:\n: What has this got to do with comp.windows.x?\n: \n\nI agree that this is a side track, but it is funny that I skip so many\nother articles (threads) but I couldn't resist reading this one.\n\nMy beliefs, opinions, and expressions are strictly my own and do not\nrepresent or reflect any official or unofficial policies or attitudes\nof any other person or organization....\n \nbut.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What is public-key cryptography?\n* What's RSA?\n* Is RSA secure?\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\n\n\n* What is public-key cryptography?\n\n  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and\n  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext\n  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\n  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\n  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\n  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\n  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\n  and Hellman in 1976.\n\n  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\n  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\n  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\n  and you don't have to worry about spies.\n\n  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\n  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\n  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\n  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\n\n* What's RSA?\n\n  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\n  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\n  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\n\n  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\n  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\n  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\n  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\n\n  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\n  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\n  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\n  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\n\n* Is RSA secure?\n\n  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\n  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\n  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\n  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\n  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\n  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\n  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\n  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\n  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\n  results.''\n\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\n\n  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\n  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\n  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\n  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\n  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\n  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\n  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\n  any case.\n\n  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\n  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\n  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\n  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\n  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\n\n  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\n  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\n  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\n  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\n  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\n  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\n\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\n\n  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.\n  But there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which\n  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be\n  difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want\n  to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the\n  books and journal articles listed in part 10.\n"}, {"text": "From: sundaram@egr.msu.edu (Divya Sundaram)\nSubject: Re: Challenge to Microsoft supporters.\nOrganization: Michigan State University\nLines: 36\nDistribution: usa\nNNTP-Posting-Host: eecae.ee.msu.edu\n\njenk@microsoft.com (Jen Kilmer) writes:\n\n[much BS deleted for brevity]\n\n>Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to \"sell\" \n>readers on our products (which would conflict with the \"no-ads\" \n>philosophy of usenet).

Center for Regional Studies\nLines: 223\n\n\nDEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]\n\n\n          Born 1972\n          Attended 9th Grade\n          Middle School No. 17\n\n          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25\n          Microdistrict No. 3\n          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]\n\nReally, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came \nhome from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \ncousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \nthat I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\n\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \ntaken for Armenians.\n\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \nbuilding where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was \npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking\npassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\n\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call \nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, \nthat's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very \nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \nthere weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\nAvakian was killed, too.\n\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We \nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\ndecided she had already left.\n\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\n\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \ncould do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He \nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \nhad knives and steel truncheons.\n\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if\nI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\npush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\n\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \nstrike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \nlose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \ntheir balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is \nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\n\nWe were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, \nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a \nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \naway, and everything will be OK.\n\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \no'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are \nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\n\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\nbefore the 27th.\n\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \nthat they were dead. My father's older brother told me.\n\nMy father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\n\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\n\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \ncalled from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of \nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \nyears old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\n\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from \nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\n\n\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\n\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\n\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\n\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\n\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \nArmenia.\n\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\ncan do that.\n\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\n\nYou can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \nin the hands of our government.\n\nJune 13,1988\n\nStepanakert \n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\nS.D.P.A.

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\nseems to argue over what.\n\n>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the \"who and \n>why\" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or \n>agnostics.\n\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \nthink the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \nincapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \n\n>Do you suggest that the \"who and why\" will forever be closed to scientific \n>investigation?\n\nNo.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \nIsn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \nconvoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  \n\n>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on\n>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.\n\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \nnaturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\n\n>|>Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\n\n>Did like your discussion around AMHs, and I did figure out what AMH was from\n>your original post :-)\n\nMuch obliged.

As published in \"US Industrial Outlook 1993\" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst's report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970's and early 1980's. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main \nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite's communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \"Asiasat-\n2\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's \naerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

So the\n  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \n  in three thousand to be cost-effective. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nUntil now, phones have happened to allow the existence of \"wiretaps\",\ndetectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over\ntime, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to\naid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption\ntechnologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly\nprivate communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it\nliterally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical\nmicrophones at either end.\n\nIn order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap\nphone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993\nthat it had developed and begun manufacturing a special \"wiretap\" chip\nto be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips\nwhich have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T\nannounced it would use these chips \"in all its secure telephone\nproducts\".\n\nEach chip would be created under government supervision, when it would\nbe given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during\neach conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other\ninfo in a special \"law enforcement block\".  Law enforcement officers\nwith a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the\nindentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in\non any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.\n\nTo date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its\nsecurity.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm, and\nmany suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it\nhas claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not\ninspire confidence on this point [1].\n\nHowever, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead\nwhether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police\ninvestigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to\ninvestigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or\ngive police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?\nOr to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for\neach wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost\nof forcing phones to support wiretaps?\n\nTo start to answer this question, we might compare the current\nbenefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected\ncosts of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current\nbenefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.\n\nWIRETAP BENEFITS\n\n1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available\n[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no\nrequests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained\nwith the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests\nresulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from\nwiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.\n76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were\nregarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal\nauthorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487\ncalls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an\naverage of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations\nreporting costs), mostly for labor.\n\nThus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain\nabout 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at\nleast four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one\ngets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the\ntotal 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per\nyear spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police\nexpenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone \"access\"\nlines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per\nphone line, or about two cents a month.\n\nIn general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination\nof a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some\nexpected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having\nwiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get\nthe same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to\nwiretap a particular suspect's phone, police might instead use hidden\nmicrophones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police\nmight focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or\nwe might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.\n\nIf we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be\non average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social\nbenefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level\nof two cents a month per phone line.\n\nWIRETAP COSTS\n\nLet us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government\nencryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would\nhave offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying\nears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and\ndomestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many\nadditional costs to build and maintain our communication system.\n\nExtra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,\nincreasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must\nbe used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing\nthese keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.\nThe chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose\ndesign is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special\nprocess so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.\n(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in\nlots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting\nwiretaps would require none of these extra costs.\n\nPerhaps most important, government degree would at least partially\nreplace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to\nbe represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is\nwidely believed that governments are less efficient than private\nenterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps\nperform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private\nstandards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say\nthey pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    \n\nCurrently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of\nU.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per\naccess line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per\nmonth, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even\nas much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!\nAnd this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because\ntheir encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones\nwouldn't have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit\nper phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGiven this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the\nphone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the\nslightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.\nWhen the only modification required was to allow investigators in to\nattach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.\nBut when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is\nclearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs\nwould really be less than the benefits.  \n\nIf consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a\ncompromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a\nrate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies\nnationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.\n\n[1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6\n\n[2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the\n    Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990,\n    Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544.\n\n[3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.  \n\n[4] Dorothy Denning, \"The Clipper Chip: A Technical Summary\",\n    distributed to sci.crypt newsgroup April 21, 1993. \n-- \nRobin Hanson  hanson@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov \n415-604-3361  MS-269-2, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035\n510-651-7483  47164 Male Terrace, Fremont, CA  94539-7921 \n"}, {"text": "From: mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca (Malcolm Lee)\nSubject: The Laws of God (was Re: A KIND and LOVING God!!)\nOrganization: Royal Roads Military College, Victoria, B.C.\nLines: 102\n\n\nIn article <1r4e63INN2kb@owl.csrv.uidaho.edu>, lanphi872@moscow.uidaho.edu (Rob Lanphier) writes:\n|>\n|> These are two conflicting statements.

In\n    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\n    special 'servers'.\n\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\n\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\n\n    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\n    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\n    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',\n    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called\n    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\n    posted.\n\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\n    it the preferred option.\n\nMAILING LISTS\n\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\n    in over a decade).

We\nalso get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The\nGrapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach\nabout what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don\nisn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were\nDon got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the\nBoston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill\nme in on this info?\n  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday\nmorning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off\nsometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave\nhigh praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not\njust a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player\nin the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour\nis a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman\nabout a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?\n  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from\ncity to city.\n  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>\n              is the best two-way player in the league today.'\n \n  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he\nbasically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.\n  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario\nLemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs\nfrom the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the\nWales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about\nLemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion\nif I'm in a different city.\n  Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get\nthis off my chest.\n \nLaurie Marshall\nWayne State University\nDetroit, Michigan\nGo Wings!!!\n"}, {"text": "From: lli+@cs.cmu.edu (Lori Iannamico)\nSubject: Re: Giveaways \nNntp-Posting-Host: lli.mach.cs.cmu.edu\nOrganization: School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon\nLines: 13\n\nIn article <1993Apr14.173826.29856@philabs.philips.com> jpc@philabs.philips.com (John P.

Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of\n> individuals which were tried in secret and for which their\n> identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are\n> state secrets ?\n\n\nApart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one\nother espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological\nInstitute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried \"in camera\". I wouldn't exactly\ncall it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate\nto disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases\nin camera.\n\n\n>\n> 5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied\n> territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?\n>\n\nNot Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the\nKNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens\nresiding in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze,\nor Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.\n\n\n\n\n> 6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48\n> to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their\n> Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?\n\nAnyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be\nconfusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the\nSix Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he\ncouldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).\n\n\n>\n> 7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed\n> an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in\n> Bosnia-Herzegovina ?\n>\n\nNo. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)\n\n\n\n> 8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as\n> members in kibbutzim?\n\nNot true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on\nkibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a\nkibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so\nin the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous\nmembership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.\n\n\n>\n> 9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage\n> marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?\n\nThe religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the\nreligious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the\nMuslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their\nreligious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious\nestablishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.\n\n>\n> 10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the\n> site of a muslim cemetery ?\n\nI believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd\nlike to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not\nheld that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of\nTrade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that\nwas built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.\n\n\nJosh\nbackon@VMS.HUJI.AC.IL\n\n\n\n>\n\n\n> Thanks,\n>\n> Elias Davidsson Iceland email:   elias@ismennt.is\n\n"}, {"text": "From: slosser@ntsc-rd.navy.MIL (Steve Slosser)\nSubject: UNIX interest group:  Where is it?\nOrganization: The Internet\nLines: 17\nNNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu\nTo: \"xpert\" <xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu>\n\nI know that this is not the correct place to post this, but I have \nexhausted all other logical options.

The neon reionizes but does not draw\nsufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.\n-- \nMustafa Kocaturk   mustafa@seas.smu.edu  EE Dept., Room 305A, Caruth Bldg.\nHome: 214-706-5954  Office: 214-768-1475  SMU Box 753190, Dallas, TX 75275\n"}, {"text": "From: jgfoot@minerva.cis.yale.edu (Josh A.
