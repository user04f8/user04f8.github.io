This\nview must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone\nto take it seriously.\n\n>I am trying very hard to be amicable and rational.  \n\nAnd I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my\nhonest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated\n(or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion\nthat most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless\npropaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical\ninterpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's\nessays, which is more than my correspondents have done.

Or is there something that I'm not doing right,\nand Q6 can actually do that?  Anyway, MYM seems to be able to handle\nmonthly deductions.

Modern Pentecostalism was developing\nas a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,\nemphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and\nindwelling of the Holy Spirit.\n\tMany 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became known\nas conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was\nin full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.\n\tWhen the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and \n1960's),\nmany 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches and\nby what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groups\nand spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's.  In 1969, even the\nCatholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other \ngroups...still\nevident today.\n\n\tThe Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant\ngroup.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it\nwas generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly \nresistant\nto change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.\n\tThe magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it\nunfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out to\ncollege students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus \nEvangel-\nism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,\nplayed a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people \nbegan\nto speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).\n\tThis was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of \nChrist.\nIn some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or \nfor\nadvocating the \"Holy Spirit Movement\", another name for the new branch.  The\nterm \"Underground Church of Christ\" also came into use because these people \nhad\nto hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).\n\tThere were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were\nreceptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never \nreally\ncaught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,\nFL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, \nand\nthe new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also \nseemed\nto put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.\n\tIn October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to\nbe its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's\n(lead) Minister.  In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with \nmany\nother groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring \nBreak.\nThey organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.\nThey also worked with UF sports people.\n\tIn 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.\nWhen it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer\nappropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name\nthat would become legendary.\n\n\tBy this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs\nwere fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn't start it, they \ncontinued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.\n\tBy 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that\nthey could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal\nproblems at Crossroads.\n\tCrossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require \nattendance\nat all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to have\nat least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of\nyour problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer \nPartners,\nwhich later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  The\nleadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.\n\tThe book called \"The Master Plan of Evangelism\" was a strong influence\non Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person's duty\nand life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growing\nin number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).\n\tA person who \"was evangelistic\" was \"spiritual\".  Evangelism meant\ninviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them\nconverted, then you were \"spiritual\".  There were sermons about how if you\nbought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to\nservices.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since these\npeople needed Jesus, you should be \"aggressive\"--don't take 'no' for an\nanswer.\n\tIf you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called \"lazy\" or\n\"unspiritual\".\n\tBy the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated \ninto\na structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Then\nthe group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in had\nsomeone placed over them.\n\tIt is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads\nbegan to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus\nwas tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate\nproblem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its \"pushy\"\nevangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ\nto be \"dead\" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting\nout of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.\n\n\tBy this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)\nwhere not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but\nalso they were sending out \"planting\" [create a new church] and \n\"reconstructing\"\n[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, the\nCrossroads Movement was underway.\n\tA group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in \nBoston,\nMA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a\nfraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view of\nchurch authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),\nand not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the \ncongregation\nthat he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong\nwith his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-\none\nChristianity.  [Called this by critics]\n\tIn the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want \nto\nbe a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming into\nthe new Boston Church of Christ.\n\tAh, but I'm ahead of myself.\n\tAt Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on\nthe members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but\nthey were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers were\ndropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadership\nbegan to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely\n\"unproductive\" and \"unfruitful\".  The \"fruit\" passages in the NT were \ninterpreted\nas referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, \nyou\nwould be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]\n\tIf you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to church\nand convert him).  If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor.\nAnd if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding.  The logical arguments\ncontinue in this vein.\n\tIn 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to \nrecurring\nsins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at\nlarge, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  \nFor\nby now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most\nCrossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus should\nbe on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]\n\tChuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the\nBoston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' \nsessions\nfor other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-\nroads ready to emphasize the \"total commitment\" to the church that Boston and\nKip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at \nCrossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.\nBoston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under\nthe direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their \nbelief\nthat each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston \nChurches\nof Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since\nCrossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement.  The group\nnow numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).\n\tThe Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary\nelement of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship'\nbaptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be\nbaptized.  You had to 'count the cost'.  At Boston, they took this a step\nfurther.  If at some time you became \"unproductive\", then your spirituality\nwas suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you\nwere getting into.  Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid:  \nthey\nhadn't counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others \ncalled\nthis \"rebaptism\", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice.\n\tWhen Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its\nmembers left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were\nnow called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) \nor\nyou were \"dead\".  They also used the nickname \"Movement of God\" for a while.\n\tBy Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now\nstood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,\nand now none in the Movement.\n\n\tBoston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that\nthey had been following.  They sent \"reconstruction teams\" to many cities, \nwhich\nusually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging \nother\nchurches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the \"remnant\".\nThe \"remnant\" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It was\nfelt that the \"remnant\" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes they\nwould simply call their Movement \"the church\".\n\tThey usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the\nother Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Many\ncampuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there\ndue to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented that\nBoston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to \nhave\naccess to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed \"perse-\ncution\", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you really\na Christian if you're not being persecuted?\n\tThe numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they have\nfought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the\nleaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) as\nGod commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and\nobedience.\n\n\tCrossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by the\nCult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,\nunder a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  The\nterm \"cult\" is usually differentiated from \"sect\" by the practice of those\ntechniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being\ntechniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding\nDiscipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many\nothers have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt \nmotivation,\nemotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort\nof mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.\n\n\tI have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-\nous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a 'falling\nout' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they \nteach.\nI recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.\nI hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their\nmistakes either.\n\tI want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which\nare in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much\nvictims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoys\nmanipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel\naccountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  When\nmembers do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel\npersonally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.\nThey want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.\n\n\tI have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are many\nexamples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston \nbulletins)\nthat I could include.  But this is too long already.  You may post this if\nyou so desire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrank D.\n\n\n\n| \"Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.\" |\n| \"Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.\"  |\n| (proverbs 26:4&5)\n\n\n[Believe it or not, questions about the Boston Church of Christ are\namong the most commonly asked.

This corresponds to a\nNyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if\nyou think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A\nconverter will probably not present you with a signal that has been\ncut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher\nfrequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome\nthat problem.)\n\nOn the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,\nyou could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and\nthen linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,\nbut it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in\nthat respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, and\ncompression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of\nless than 5% were common.

These people -- and those associated with them\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\n    ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not\n    have this blessing.\n\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\n    before then.\n\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\n    was not significantly revised in the \"Joseph Smith Translation\" or\n    \"Inspired Version\" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.\n\n-- \nRich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

The Carver\namps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit \n(I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, and\nI beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found that\nit had three rail voltages that it switched between.

Jesus said \n          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I \n          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he \n          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye \n          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the \n          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the \n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\n\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)\n\n          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \n          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit \n          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)\n\n          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the \n          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he \n          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)\n\n     One becomes a child of God...\n\n          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\n          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)\n\n          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that\n          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us\n          not, because it knew him not.

(John 1:13)\n\n          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus\n          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,\n          (Ephesians 1:5)\n\n          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should\n          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)\n\n          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of\n          God.

The fact that some groups try to read \n     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For \n     example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ \n     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,\n     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\n     Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus\n     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through\n     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)] \n     on the Deity of Christ.\n\n     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not \n     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that \n     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, \n     you have to look at the Bible.\n\nra> >     \"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\" (_The\nra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \"He had to work out his own salvation by\nra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\" (ibid., p.54), \"he had\nra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\" (_Mormon\nra> >     Doctrine_, p.71).\nra>\nra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The curious part is that no one addressed the\n     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \"I\n     have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.\n\n     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n     subject is the real issue.

Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\nu o  \\upsilon \\zeta $); He  was crucified,\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\n\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\n\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\nand energy.\n\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nthought alone.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis\nof the Logos Incarnate.\n\n[...]\n\nI guess that adresses your question adequately.\n\nAs for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the\ndiscussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see\nhow they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an\nendless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief\nanswer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church \nregarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.\nis exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n"}, {"text": "From: cca20@keele.ac.uk (J.

To test a Centronics 25-pin parallel port, you'll need to\nconnect pins 1 to 13; 2 to 15; 10 to 16; 11 to 17; and 12 to 14 in a male\nDB-25 connector.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-Stan Wszola\n---\n\nI haven't tried it.

There are at least two\nmeanings of the word \"once\".  1) only one time, and 2) at some\nother time (i.e. once upon a time).  Note that in the previous\nverse, the word \"once\" is used with the second meaning, and also\nin the following verse, \"once\" is again used with the second meaning.\nThe Greek, I am sure, uses different words for each of the two meanings\nfor the English word \"once\".  I am not a Greek scholar, but I'm sure\nsomeone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning.\nIf the second meaning is being used, that verse can be interpreted as:\n\n  - for it was once given for men to die (beginning with Adam), but \n    after this [gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ] the judgement\n    [is made available], for now there is no longer death, but life\n    with Christ.\n-- \n===========================================================================\nDaniel Cossack                |  danc@procom.com, 71333.2102@compuserve.com\nSenior Software Engineer      |  2181 Dupont Drive, Irvine, CA 92715\nProcom Technology, Inc.       |  +1 714 852 1000\n"}, {"text": "From: j_manning@csc32.enet.dec.com (John Manning)\nSubject: Re: Mitsumi and SB Pro\nOrganization: Digital Equipment Corporation\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 22\n\n\nIn article <21APR199311301194@elroy.uh.edu>, st1r8@elroy.uh.edu (B.J.

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers.\n\n The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real\n nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can\n be undone.\"\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n> The same\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.
