As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):\n(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \"the problem.\"\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou're completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you've got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\n\n. Let your shoulders relax.\n. Let your elbows swing free.\n. Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don't slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.\n\nIf you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\nwonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the\nabove sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.\n\n==6== References\n\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

Basically, you look into a room that looks\nsimilar to the following:\n\n                             xxxx\n                         xxxxx   xxxx\n                     xxxx    x       xxxx\n                 xxxx        x           xxxx\n             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx\n             x           xxxx    xxxx           x\n             x       xxxx            xxxx       x\n             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x\n             xxxx              3 /|\\         xxxx\n                 xxxx            /~\\     xxxx\n                     xxxx            xxxx\n                         xxxx    xxxx\n                             xxxx\n\nThe good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move\naround in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision.

(I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).\n\nI've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\n\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I'm\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\n\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\nshape?\n\nCurrently I take:\n\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n\nand produce:\n            \n             1  2  3  4\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\n                                    61 62 63 64\n\nLine 1 follows the slope.

I have MD friends who can't\nmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance\nrates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical\nmonopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they\nmust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\n\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\n\n>WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  \n>FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  \n>\n>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  \n>care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  \n>hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  \n>insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  \n>a month.  \n\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\nbenefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\ncovered for basic care.\n\nAt that point, they wouldn't even consider a \"voucher\" approach\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\n\n>******************************************************************  \n>\n>WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  \n>ACHE AND PAIN?  \n>\n>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  \n>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  \n>bills.  \n>\n>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower  \n>per-person health bill than we do.\n\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\nnaifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\n\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer \n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \n1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\n\n>ISN'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  \n>AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  \n>\n>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  \n>\"politically thorny,\" in the quiet words of one advocate for a  \n>national plan.

You can opt out in Canada\nand Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\n\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\nthe fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec\nlast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against\nany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's\npublic health insurance plan.\n\ngld\n--\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGary L.

The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close\nto the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so\nmuch a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.\nWhy else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business\napplication. \n\nWhat do you mean by 'no \"retail price\"'.  Quite the contrary, I think.\nThe price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,\nIMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling\nrequired.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One\nprice, medium performance, ready to go.\n\nWhen I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears\n(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and\nBizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the\nother was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who\nwent the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who\nsells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I\nsuspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know\ndidly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any\nof the  Apple dealers I spoke with...\n\nIf you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from\nMontgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.\nI'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple\nPerforma Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that\ndecision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out\nwith a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.  \n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstrument Approach Procedures Automation             DOT/FAA/AMI-230\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBryan D.

Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 117\n\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.

Despite its small size and quickness,\n+  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:\n+  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,\n+  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or\n+  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n+  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n+  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n+  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\n+  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\n+  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\n+  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\n+  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\n+  \n+  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\n+  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\n+  \n+  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n+  \n+  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\n+  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\n+  \n+  Authors: Many.

Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

It can import raw\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

The thing is, in order to\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\nThat you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content.

SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.\n\nA SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data\nfrom the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data\nand moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate\neven better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape\nunits.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is\nissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other\ndevices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do\nsomething else while backing up your hard drive :-).

A-10 exhibited\nneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.\n\nIt is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's\ntheory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to\nPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying\npeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for\nantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1\nmixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a\nchemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically\nextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are\nhabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects\nof thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10\ndoes not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce\nteratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.\n\nMany of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early\nresearch, past and present support by others for his work have been\nshown to be untrue.\n\n\nsdb\n---\nsdb@ssr.com\n\n"}, {"text": "From: REXLEX@fnal.fnal.gov\nSubject: Re: RE: Does God love you?\nOrganization: FNAL/AD/Net\nLines: 70\n\nIn article <Apr.13.00.08.10.1993.28382@athos.rutgers.edu> jayne@mmalt.guild.org\n(Jayne Kulikauskas) writes:\n\n>I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be \n>an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.

Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\nextremes before stopping at \"moderation.\"  I think we have seen the extreme of\nthe \"hell fire & brimstone\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\nsensibilities.\n\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\npoint of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\nwouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\n\nI'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. \nWhen I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that\nisn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. \nIt's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\nis still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness\nwhich includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,\nthen broad is the way to distruction.\n\n>\n>Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are \n>afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?\n\nI think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,\nrepentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!\nNo, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we\nshould do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  \n\nI have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.

Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.\n   If responsible, then he is also accountable.\n3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.\n4) Christ.

If the investigation indicates a\n   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,\n   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the\n   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to\n   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the\n   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved\n   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I\n   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but\n   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not\n   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\n\nIt may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what\nhappened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying\nthat a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a\nCatholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being\ncalled a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an\noffense, but not a heretic.\n\nTheologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent\none must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by\nGod through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due\nto a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes\ndemand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human\nhistory.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.\n\n\"Approval\" of an apparition by the Church principally means that\nwhatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.\n\nI personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling\nus what to do at particular periods in history.

What do you think 75% of you is?\n\nBut whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the\nneutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water\nturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would \nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\n\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\nis clearly appropriate.\n\n>>  Plus these things have no self-\n>>defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as\n>>a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use\n>>(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration\n>>(translation:  cities and population centers).\n\n>\tIf the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal\n>government, they are indeed useful weapons to the militia.\n\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\nfor that.\n\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\n\n                                                  Frank Crary\n                                                  CU Boulder\n\n"}]}
