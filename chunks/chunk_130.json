Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the\nlong cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  I\nwould suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short\npeaks.\n\nYou can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or try\nstrapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,\nwhich will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you're\ngoing to need a bigger generator.\n\nI assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched the\nvoltage output on the generator properly.

In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I'll\nalso stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the\nterm for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would\nmean for Paul's readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter\nthan my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us\nwith some of the major divisions within Christ's body, and I am not trying\nto open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that\nseparate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely\ncharacterizable as \"liberal\") will be evident, but I am not grinding an\naxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD\nto reach \"closure\" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we\neach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.\n\nSo; stipulating Paul's intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS\nREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is\na second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?\n\nSince Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st\nCorinthians, there are two \"positive\" answers and one \"negative\" to this\nquestion:\n\n+\ta.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has\n\t    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-\n\t    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be\n\t    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no\n\t    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence\n\t    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]\n\n+\tb.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,\n\t    what God means \"behind\" Paul's inspired word-choice.)\n\n-\tc.  We *don't* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-\n\t    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,\n\t    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ (\"those who have\n\t    more\" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is \"obvious\" from\n\t    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB\n\t    translates it as \"grabbers\") or even _methusoi_ (\"drunkards\"\n\t    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,\n\t    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)\n\nThe three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration\nfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards\ntradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical\ndemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.\n\n_ad_ a:\tIt is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the\n\tcommunity of Christ's disciples and their successors, and that\n\tour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.\n\tBut it's also the case that we know little or nothing about this\n\ttradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that\n\twe have access to the tradition only after several generations of\n\tpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only\n\tdocumentation of the tradition in the critical era.\n\n_ad_ b:\tIf we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an\n\tattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-\n\tstanding the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of\n\tmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit\n\tfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But\n\tthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit\n\tas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that\n\ttakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent\n\tunderstanding supposedly derived from the \"clear\" Word of God.\n\n\t\t[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought\n\t\tconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even\n\t\twhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;\n\t\tthe more bizarre forms of \"I will read Scripture my way\"\n\t\tare primarily a fringe aspect of \"cultic\" Protestantism.]\n\n\tThe main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no\n\tmeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel\n\t*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible\n\tconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind\n\t\"convinced\" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously\n\turge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian\n\tagainst Christian.  To what purpose?\n\n_ad_ c:\tThe critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can\n\treach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open\n\tto all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually\n\tpossible. :-)\n\n\t[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;\n\tone complaint against critical methodology is that it \"dissolves\"\n\tfaith -- but surely a \"faith\" that cannot honestly face the evalu-\n\tation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to\n\taddress.]\n\nAnyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between\n\"liberal\" and \"conservative\" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme\nzealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition\ntends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that\ndespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as\nultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I\npredict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position\nits due, but no more than its due. \n\nSecond question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of \"spiritual\"\nChristians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,\nthat Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against\nmale-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-\nbility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it's precisely\nwhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they're most dangerous.\n\nWe have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of\ntradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).\nWe have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the\ntraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus\nand Peter and Paul do not so much \"throw out\" tradition as subject it to\nradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:\n\n     \"the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Matthew 23:23)\nand  \"On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,\n      and the Prophets, also.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Matthew 22:40)\n\nIf there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the\nchallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation\nto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts\n(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus' reported\nwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination\nto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges\nagainst are in fact open to challenge.\n\nAll traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may\nlead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual\ninstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and\ninherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is\nimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy\nand good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from\nlove of God and love of neighbor.\n\nI am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That\nthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am\ntoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I\n*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians\nappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated\n\"sodomites\" as the \"cause\" of the earthquake, so that legislation was\npassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in\naccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human\ntradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much\ndifferent in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick\nto condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,\nthen I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord\nis that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,\nfor the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.\n\nAnd I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel\nsaid to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:\n\n\t\"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,\n\tthis movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of\n\tits own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not\n\tonly be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves\n\tfighting against God.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[Acts 5:36...39] \n\nAll I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures\nwith a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our\nfirst Christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER\nreadings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and\nrabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the\nlove of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of\nChristians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to\njudge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of\nthe Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who\nare NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God's truth.\n-- \nMichael L. Siemon\t\tI say \"You are gods, sons of the\nmls@panix.com\t\t\tMost High, all of you; nevertheless\n    - or -\t\t\tyou shall die like men, and fall\nmls@ulysses.att..com\t\tlike any prince.\"   Psalm 82:6-7\n\n[There's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to\nwhether you're speaking of tradition in Paul's time or ours.  I think\nthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and\nhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words\nin the context of that shared tradition.  That's what makes me think\nthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that\nPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.\nEverything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.\nThe tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with\nthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren't the most\ngeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there's\nsome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of\nevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no\nevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of\nhomosexuality.\n\nBut when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that's rather a\nhorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a\ncontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition\nmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul's original\nmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted\nhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in\nour time because of the universal judgement of the church between his\ntime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.\nA radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.\ntradition to illuminate Paul's original meaning, but not use the\nCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to\nhomosexuality should be.\n\n--clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: fiddler@concertina.Eng.Sun.COM (steve hix)\nSubject: Re: ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH!

A columnist for the St. \nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\tSo, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n\t\n\tGo Sabres!\n\t\n\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\n\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: gwittt@alleg.edu (Tom Gwitt)\nSubject: Re: Buffalo Sabres\nOrganization: Allegheny College\nLines: 15\n\nIn article <1r8pc7$sa5@msuinfo.cl.msu.edu> vergolin@euler.lbs.msu.edu  \n(David Vergolini) writes:\n>   Ok, Buffalo fans.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nJohn Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\nGIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on\nexport or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\ninternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\ndisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\nbe blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n\n-- \n\t\t\ttom lane\n\t\t\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\n"}, {"text": "From: 9130037@golum.riv.csu.edu.au (CHAN Yin Mei)\nSubject: Help!

Philbrick had become an\nAmerican folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting\ncolleagues.  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films\nportraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot.  In\nBoston, where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant, Communist\nParty member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert\nPhilbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque.\n\nFor Bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with his\nhomosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s, the life of a double agent\nwas the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist\nmenace.\n\n\"I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick,\" Bullock recently told\nfederal investigators, \"and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the\nCommunist Part.  In 1957, I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student\nFestival in Moscow with the American delegation.  I gave them [the FBI\na full report on it when I returned, along with some photos I took of\nsome Soviet military vehicles.\"\n\nBullock was hooked.  For the next two years, he worked as an unpaid\ninformant for the FBI.  But he found his true calling when he became a\npaid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960.  Now his activities\nare at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent\nAmerican history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal\nindictment in San Francisco.\n\nOver a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876\nindividuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes,\nincluding the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American Indian\nMovement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP,\nPalestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americans\nfor Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock, who even\nspied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when\nhe visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files on\nanti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile,\nbetween 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using a\nprominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its\nfinancial relationship with Bullock.\n\nLast month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San\nFrancisco, as well as Bullock's home, confiscating computer files and\nboxes of documents.  According to court records, Bullock's files\ncontained the driver's license and vehicle registration information,\nin addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was\nallegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock, 58, told\nthe FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base\nhad been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  \"Based on the\nevidence,\" says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, \"I believe\nthat Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them\nwith confidential criminal and DMV information.\"\n\nWhat's more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for\ntapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false\nidentities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized from\nBullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area\ntrash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the\nChristic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone message\nslips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers),\noffice correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the\nsenders, and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from Christic\nInstitute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings,\nas well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the\ndates, and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic\nInstitute's checking account.\n\nInvestigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed\nthat the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material\nwith Israeli government officials.  What's more, Israel apparently used\ntips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there.\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nThe ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, and\nlater other minority groups, from discrimination.  It led the fight\nagainst racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the\nAmerican Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights\nmovement.\n\nBut there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s, the ADL spied on\nleftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the House\nCommittee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swung\nsharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming a\nbastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyite\nwho heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department, the real danger\nto Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists,\nblacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in\nAmerica, as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of his\nideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL's vast\nnetwork of informants, who were given code names like \"Scumbag,\"\n\"Ironside,\" and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta\n-- \"Flipper.\"\n\nFor years, journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community\nknew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups.  As long as the targets\nwere anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon\nLarouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled.  But the Bullock\ncase reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent,\nand progressive orientation.  This apparent massive violation of civil\nliberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco,\nwhere the investigation began.  The human rights group faces possible\ncriminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including an\nindictment for gaining illegal access to police computers.  Says one\nsource close to the West Coast investigation, \"It is 99 per cent\ncertain that the ADL will be indicted.\"\n\nIn the wake of the San Francisco investigation, police probes of ADL\nspying are spreading to other parts of the country.  \"We have received\nnumerous complaints about ADL [spying],\" says Sam Adams, a\nspokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland, Oregon.\n\nOn April 16, the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York, and\nAfrican American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on,\nwrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, requesting \"an immediate\ninvestigation\" of the ADL.  \"The ADL's actions cause great concern, as\nit is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil\nrights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San\nFrancisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism.\"\n\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office, says, \"We\nhave no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation.\"\nMcKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San\nFrancisco D.A.'s office on their pending investigation.  \"They have\nnot, so far, asked for our assistance.\"\n\nThe ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with\nlaw enforcement officials.  It also admits to maintaining extensive\nfiles on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-page\npress release, \"The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of news\nclips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents....\"\n\n\"ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance\nviolations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency,\nand the process by which the League gathers information is presently\nunder review to insure that no laws are being violated.\"\n\nThat's what the ADL says for public consumption.  But morale is so low\nthat its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits.  And\neven as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show\nof solidarity, many do so holding their noses.  More than a few Jewish\nofficials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human\nrights group or a secret police agency.\n\n\"The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the\nJewish community as the definitive source of information on anti-\nSemitism and extremist groups,\" says Daniel Levitas, the former\nexecutive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-\nbased group that monitors anti-Semitism, racism, and hate groups.\n\"One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely\ntainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to its\nobjectivity.  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the\nJewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous\nwith American Jewry.\"\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nBullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well\nwith the ADL's Cold War worldview.  In 1960, he moved to Southern\nCalifornia where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week.  Bullock\nalmost always used his real name when snooping, although he once\ncalled himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of\nAlabama governor George Wallace.  Bullock provided the ADL's office in\nLos Angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to Fact\nFinding Department head Irwin Suall, according to court records.\nUnder Suall's stewardship, Fact Finding Department had become the\nADL's heart and soul.  Located at ADL national headquarters across\nfrom the United Nations, the department had assembled a vast library\non \"hate groups,\" culling material from publications, speeches, and\ninformants reports.\n\nBullock was more than adept at leading a double life.  Not long after\nmoving to California, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John\nBirch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston office.\nThere, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL.  The\ndiscovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that\nthey had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers.\n\nBullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups\nuntil the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by\nHarvey Schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well.  A\nfew years later, Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco\nwhere he posed as an art dealer.  And ADL fact finder who had\ninfiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed.  When the\nensuing scandal died down, Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate\nthe Arabs.\n\nThe ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee, founded by the former South Dakota senator\nJames Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing.  In a page out of the CIA's\ndirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, Bullock\njoined the ADC, and then recruited Nazis into the group, apparently\ntrying to discredit it, according to published reports.\n\nIn 1987, the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of\nArab Americans annual congress in Washington.  According to court\ndocuments, Bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds.\nBullock was unable to \"follow the money.\"  But he did such a good job\nat ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA\ndelegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIt's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations.  But\nonly acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP.  As\nfar as Bullock was concerned, gay groups in San Francisco were heavily\ninfiltrated by what he called \"gay left revolutionaries,\" prompting\nhim to write about their activities for the ADL.\n\nBullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm of\nforeign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut, the head of ADL's San\nFrancisco office, introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986.  Gerard was\nthen a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's\nIntelligence Unit.  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the\nCIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had more\nthan a passing interest in right-wing death squads.  (Police searching\nGerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and\ninterrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well as\npassports made out to Gerard in 10 different names, including Thomas\nClouseau.  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines\nwhere he fled last November, Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he\nwill blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American death\nsquads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.)\n\nAfter their very first encounter in the ADL office, Gerard and Bullock\nhad lunch at McDonald's, \"I liked Tom right off,\" Bullock later told a\nSan Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation\nwas obtained by the _Voice_.  \"Tom is a very charming, roguish\ncharacter, with a great deal of integrity.  Let me say here, I\nconsider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever worked\nwith, absolutely.  Honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percent\nAmerican.\"\n\nBefore long, Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL\nreports on various groups and individuals.  In turn, Gerard gave\nBullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans,\nskinheads, and others.  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's material\nended up in his ADL reports.  \"I would say 99 percent of the data that\nI got was name, address, and sometimes physical description.  Criminal\nhistory, very rarely,\" Bullock told investigators.  Gerard also gave\nBullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American\nbusinessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East\nterror groups, as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans\nreceiving weapons training overseas.  Bullock claims that U.S. Customs\nin New York gave Gerard the photos.  \"It was understood that Bullock\nwould be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard\ngave him, and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or\nother law enforcement officers,\" says an FBI report.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about Bullock's cozy relationship with law\nenforcement.  By the mid-1980s, the ADL was swapping files with\nhundreds of \"official friends,\" the organization's euphemism for U.S.\nlaw enforcement and intelligence sources.  The ADL's relationship with\nthe FBI's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL's reports on\nArab American group's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were \"must\nreading.\"\n\nIt's no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI report\nentitled \"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)--New\nYork Area\" while searching the ADL's San Francisco office.  In 1987,\nADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in\nCalifornia universities on student visas.  When the ADL discovered\nthey were disseminating PFLP literature, it informed the FBI, which in\nturn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nAfter the INS ordered the students deported as subversives, ADL\nregional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_\nabout his office's cooperation with law enforcement, although he's\nbackpedaling now.  The \"Los Angeles 8\" deportation is still under\nappeal.\n\n                            *     *     *\n\nWhile the ADL worked quietly with America's top cops, it enjoyed\nsimilar ties with Israel's spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leaders\nvehemently deny.  But as early as July 7, 1961, ADL director Benjamin\nEpstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes,\nrequesting $25,000 for his investigators.  \"Our information,\" he\nboasted to Joftes, \"in addition to being essential for our own\noperations, has been of great value and service to both the United\nStates Department and the Israeli Government.  All data have been made\navailable to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are\nthe source.\"\n\nIn 1987, the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard\nspy scandal.  While assigned to the Navy's Anti-Terrorist Alert\nCenter, where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets,\nJonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for\nIsrael, which, according to federal prosecutors, \"could fill a room\nthe size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet.\"\nPollard's handler was Avi Sella, an Israeli air force colonel whose\nwife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.  Pollard later wrote to\nfriends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli\nspy operation.\n\nWhile there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was\ninvolved with Pollard, there is evidence that the ADL freely passes\ninformation to Israeli intelligence.  In March 1993, the FBI\ninterrogated David Gurvitz, an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until\n1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police\ninformation to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\nThe FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information\nto Israel.  Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law\nenforcement contact that Michael Elias, allegedly a member of a\nradical PLO faction, was scheduled to travel from San Francisco\nInternational Airport en route to Haifa.  Gurvitz phoned the deputy\nIsraeli consul general in L.A. with the information.  \"Later the same\nday,\" according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the\n_Voice_, \"Gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was from\nthe Israeli Consulate, and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information\nabout Elias.  Gurvitz did not get this man's name, but their\nconversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was\nactually an Israeli Consulate official.\"\n\nAmong the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADL\nfiles in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad, a 36-year-old Chicago\nresident who was arrested in Israel on January 25, for allegedly\ndistributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas, the large\nIslamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories.  The\nChicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work\nwith \"official friends\" in local law enforcement, according to\ndocuments released by the San Francisco D.A. and sources close to the\nADL.  Given these facts, Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has\npassed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence.\n\nOne technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American\ncommunity in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral\nnotices.  According to sources familiar with the practice, ADL\ninvestigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals,\nwhich sometimes turned into PLO rallies.  Palestinians have been\ndetained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been\nfilmed attending a funeral in Chicago, according to Suhail Miari, the\nexecutive director of the United Holy Land Fund, whose cousin was an\nArab member of Israel's Knesset.\n\nShortly after Jarad was arrested, the Israeli government announced\nthat Hamas was being run from America with money and operational\ninstructions relayed by courier or fax.  Israel's charges were played\nup on the front page of _The New York Times_.  According to well-\nplaced sources, Yehudit Barsky, an ADL fact finder in New York, worked\nclosely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification,\nintroducing \"friendly\" reporters to \"official friends\" in Chicago law\nenforcement.\n\nBarsky, who is fluent in Arabic, prepared an ADL report about how\nHamas is funded in America.  She identified the Dallas-based Islamic\nassociation for Palestine in North America as the front organization\nfor Hamas in the U.S.A.  \"Its infrastructure functions as an\ninterlocking network of organizations, small businesses, and\nindividual activists,\" says the February 1993 ADL report, which\noutlines the organization's development, its activities on U.S.\ncollege campuses, and its \"metamorphosis\" during the Gulf War. It\nalso traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front-\ngroups from Plainfield, Indiana, to Culver City, California.  It is\ndoubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data\nwithout the help of \"official friends\" and ADL spies.\n\nBarsky refused to comment.  But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as\nmany as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for\nAIPAC, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_.\n\"The level of cooperation was very close,\" Slabodkin said during a\nrecent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school.\n\"If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL.\"\n\nWhen Sha'wan Jabarin, a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker in\nthe Occupied Territories won a $25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in\n1990, Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man's entire\npolice file, which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy.  Jabarin\nhad been arrested numerous times in Israel, and once confessed to\nbeing a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured.\nJabarin, who received a short jail term, became an Amnesty\nInternational Prisoner of Conscience.  Of course, to AIPAC and the\nADL, Jabarin was a terrorist.  Slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabs\non him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award, called a\nrepresentative of Al Haq, the Palestinian human rights group that\nemployed Jabarin, to obtain his itinerary.  AIPAC even opened a file\non musician Jackson Browne, who presented Jabarin with the Reebok\naward.\n\nWhile the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of\nArabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far harder\ntime explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\nDavid Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact\nfinder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989, ADL files already bulged\nwith information about the Israel-South African connection and anti-\napartheid groups.  \"Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely\ncollect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in\nthe United States,\" says the FBI report.  While Gurvitz said there\nwere files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s, he estimated\nthe oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the\nlate 1970s, paralleling Begin's rise to power in Israel and a\ndeepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa. \"In\nabout August, 1992,\" says the report of the FBI's March 3, 1993,\ninterview with Gurvitz, \"an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at\nthe South African Consulate in Los Angeles.  Participating in the\ndemonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist\nWorkers Party.  Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions,\nand a subsequent demonstration.  He wrote a report for the ADL on each\nof the planning sessions and on the demonstration.  Copies of the\nreports were disseminated to Bullock, among others, in care of the San\nFrancisco ADL office.\"\n\nIn 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African\nConsulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting\norganized by Willis Carto, the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby.\n\"Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is,\"\nsays the FBI report, \"Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want\nto warn the South Africans.  Gerard agreed and informed the Consul\nGeneral, who canceled his appearance.\"\n\nA few months later, Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African\nintelligence officer wanted to meet them.  During a rendezvous in a\nhotel near Fisherman's Wharf, the South African said he was interested\nin acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists.  The\nSouth African, who called himself Mr. Humphries, also asked for\ninformation about groups that were advocating divestments.  \"Gerard,\nwho was present throughout the meeting,\" says the FBI report, \"told\nHumphries that he [Gerard] had been employed by the CIA....Humphries\noffered to pay Bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information.\nBullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted\nwas already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL.\"\n\nBetween 1987 and 1991, Bullock sold information to South African\nintelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly with\nGerard.  \"Bullock said it was his impression, though Gerard never\nexplicitly told him so, (and Bullock never asked) that Gerard may have\nbeen telling the CIA about his and Bullock's contacts with the South\nAfricans,\" says the FBI report.  \"Gerard had said he knew the CIA\n'resident agent' in San Francisco....Once, after Gerard dropped\nBullock off at Bullock's residence following a meeting with Louie [who\nreplaced Humphries as their handler], Gerard said he was going to go\nto the San Francisco CIA office.\"\n\nAl the while, Gerard may have been \"tasking\" Bullock for the CIA.\n\"Bullock recalled that once, after he had met Gerard, Bullock went to\nChicago, Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL,\"\nsays the FBI report.  \"The target of the investigation was a group\ncalled the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.  Bullock learned that a\nwoman [name deleted] was transporting money between the PLO or the\nPFLP, and the United States.  Bullock told this to Gerard.  Gerard\nlater told Bullock that Gerard's 'guy at the CIA' would like to know\nmore.  Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to\ngather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.\nBullock, however, never did go back.\"\n\nGerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad, which\nmay have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel.  The\nADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials\nto Israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts\nin various intelligence agencies.  According to an affidavit by San\nFrancisco police inspector Roth, the \"all-expense paid trip [to\nIsrael] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the\nADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law\nenforcement officers from the United States.\"\n\nGerard may have liked what he saw in Israel.  A short time after\ntravelling there, he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad's\nrescue of Ethiopian Jews.\n\nAs Gerard's relationship with South Africa deepened, he talked more\nopenly about his exploits in the CIA.  \"Bullock recalled Gerard\nmentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business, and that\nGerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses,'\" says the FBI report, \"To\nthis Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined\nthat the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating.\nGerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan....\nLouie also [told Gerard and Bullock] about his adventures inside South\nAfrica as an intelligence officer.  Both Gerard and Louie traded 'war\nstories' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrow\nscrapes.'\"\n\nAlthough there is still much mystery about what triggered law\nenforcement's investigation of the ADL, it was probably the theft of\na classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI's San\nFrancisco office.  Police armed with search warrants recovered the\nreport in the ADL San Francisco office.  Gurvitz says he had sent a\ncopy of it to Mira Boland, the director of the ADL's fact finding\ndivision in Washington, D.C.  Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for\n_The Washington Times_, in which she argued that the Nation of Islam\nshould not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A.\nbecause the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone.  (Boland, who\nhad arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard,\ntestified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke, Virginia, that she had\nworked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the\nDefense Department before joining the ADL.  During the trial, Boland\nadmitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation-\nonly ADL conference.)\n\nAfter he was questioned by the FBI last fall, Gerard fled to the\nPhilippines, which has no extradition treaty with America.  Gerard is\nbelieved to have supplied information from police computers not only\nto the ADL, but to Israel and South Africa as well.  The _San\nFrancisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violating\nfederal espionage laws.\n\nAlthough Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years, and Irwin Suall\npraised him in a July 1992 memo as \"our number one investigator,\" the\nADL now argues that he was a rogue agent.  In its own defense, the ADL\nalso asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than\njournalists.  After all, ask ADL officials, don't journalists keep\nfiles?\n\nBut the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL's\nmethod of gathering information couldn't be more striking.\nJournalists place information in the public domain where they are held\naccountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel.  And for the most\npart, journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign\nand domestic police agencies.  The ADL has no such inhibition.\nBecause many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, false\ninformation collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be\ncorrected.  Once a proud human rights group, the ADL has become the\nJewish thought police.\n\n\"The ADL says it's a human rights group not just for Jews but for\neveryone,\" says Chip Berlet, a highly respected researcher at the\nMassachusetts-based Political Research Associates, which monitors\nright-wing extremist groups.  \"That's fine but it can't do that and\nspy on Palestinians.  It's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral.\"\n\n\"My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats.  Each of the\nhats independently is appropriate.  It is a broad-based human rights\ngroup that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination.\nIt is a group that defends Jews against defamation.  Entirely noble.\nNothing wrong with that hat.  It is a group, whose leaders, at least,\nconsistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics, which\nagain is entirely appropriate.  And it is a group that maintains an\ninformation-sharing arrangement with law enforcement.  Again, there is\nnothing wrong for a group to do that.\"\n\n\"But you can't do all four.  It is impossible to do all four and not\nviolate the bounds of ethics.  There's a built-in conflict of interest\nif you wear all four hats.\"\n\nADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict.\nIn a September 1, 1992, letter to the _Voice_, Foxman complained: \"ADL\nhas a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil\nrights and constitutional freedoms.  Any imputation of an effort or\nmotive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is\nfalse and baseless\"\n\n\"Throughout his pieces [on AIPAC's spying], Friedman describes the\ndissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existence\nof files as a token of McCarthyite inclination.  The depiction is\nmisleading in several ways.  Virtually every journalist, academic,\npolitician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem\nrelevant; tracing the logic of Friedman's reckless charges, the\nLibrary of Congress is tantamount to the KGB.  Moreover, disseminating\nthe public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor\nMcCarthyism.\"\n\nBut many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business.\nAsk Jesse Jackson, James Abourezk, or the leaders of the New Jewish\nAgenda -- all past targets of ADL smears.  (At the same time, the ADL\nexonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League, which assisted\nRonald Reagan's covert war against Nicaragua, a policy endorsed by ADL\nleaders.)\n\nIn the early 1980s, researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet\nfact finding head Irwin Suall, to discuss their work on anti-Semite\nLyndon LaRouche.  \"Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this\nreally terrific investigator,\" says Berlet.  \"So we introduce\nourselves, say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and\nbasically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our political\nactivities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to.\nObviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds\nadmirably.  We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling\nvery uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"And then he leans forward and says, 'The right-wing isn't the\nproblem.  The left-wing is the problem.  The Soviet Union is the\nbiggest problem in the world for Jews.  It's the American left that is\nthe biggest threat to American Jews.  You're on the wrong track.\nYou're part of the problem.'  We were stunned.  I was virtually in\ntears.  This is not how I perceived myself.  We basically stumbled out\nof there in a daze.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n               Letters (response to Friedman's article)\n\n         The Village Voice, May 18, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 20\n\nA LEAGUE OF HIS OWN\n\nRobert I. Friedman's assault on the Anti-Defamation League [The Anti-\nDefamation League Is Spying On You.\" May 11] demonstrates that he has\nan axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote.\nIt also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down\non his list.  The story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, and\noutright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from\nreality as to be farcical.  Friedman is even wrong on such basic,\neasily determined facts as where ADL was founded (Chicago, not New\nYork) and the building in which ADL'S San Francisco office is located\n(not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured).\n\nADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without\n\"spying\" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for\nthe law.  Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-\nJewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor\nthem primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings.\nThrough the years, we have published scores of reports on anti-\nSemitism emanating from both the left and the right.  In fact,\nalthough Friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary, ADL's\nprimary concern is still the far right.\n\nBecause extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL\ncan learn of their activities only by using undercover sources.\nFriedman's hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in a\nmanner directly analogous to investigative journalists.  Some have\nperformed great service to the American people -- for example, by\nuncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training\ncamps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk.  The\ninformation ADL obtains is placed in the public domain, and through\nthe years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting.\n\nFriedman's article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation that\nit would take an article equally as long to set the record straight.\nA few examples:  He states that an \"ADL leader was deeply involved in\nthe [Jonathan Pollard] Israeli spy operation,\" and that Pollard's\nhandler's wife \"worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.\"  Not true.\nFriedman also states:  \"ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped\nPalestinian funerals.\"  Not true.  Elsewhere, he asserts that ADL was\nobsessed \"with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\"  Again, not true.\nWe could go on and on -- and, of course, Friedman does not reveal\n*his* sources.\n\nThe distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further\nreveal his lack of objectivity.  When it comes to how much ADL paid\nRoy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee\n(an important distinction Friedman also fails to make) -- he includes\nthe zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a large\nnumber.  By contrast, when he observes that ADL paid Bullock \"nearly\n$170,000\" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out that\namounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum.\n\nWhat is accurate about Friedman's story is Chip Berlet's description\nof ADL's four hats.  Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and\ndiscrimination.  Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics.  And yes,\nADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement\nregarding extremist activities and hate crimes.  We see no conflict in\nthese four activities, and we believe most _Voice_ readers won't\neither.\n\nABRAHAM FOXMAN\nNational Director\nAnti-Defamation League\nManhattan\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nROBERT I. FRIEDMAN REPLIES:\n\nFor the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd.\nJournalists don't spy on Arabs and anti-apartheid activists and then\nfreely pass their files to South African and Israeli intelligence.\nBut according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators,\nbuttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews, the ADL\ndoes.  Indeed, the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti-Semitic\nnor violent.  Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstream\ngroups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now.  Respected intellectuals and\nMiddle East scholars who disagree with the ADL's political views have\nended up on ADL blacklists, their reputations smeared.  \"Private\norganizations have no business paying operatives inside police\ndepartments or having spies,\" says an April 17 editorial in the _St.\nLouis Post-Dispatch_, condemning ADL spying.  On April 10, police\narmed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco and\nL.A. after concluding that \"ADL employees were apparently less than\ntruthful\" in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier\nsearch, according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth's sworn\naffidavit.  Roth also asserts that Bullock was a \"paid employee for\nthe ADL.\"  If so, by failing to pay taxes on $170,000 of income paid\nto Bullock, the ADL could face a total of 48 felony counts, according\nto court papers.  The ADL may also face felony charges for illegally\nobtaining confidential information from police computers.  As for\nerrors:  The ADL was founded in Chicago, and moved to New York in\n1947.  But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco building\nshown in the _Voice_ photo, moving out a few months ago.  I never\nwrote that an \"ADL leader was deeply involved in the [Pollard]\nIsraeli spy operation.\"  I reported that Pollard himself made the\ncharge.  And in court papers, Pollard's own lawyer said that the wife\nof Pollard's handler worked for the ADL.  If I have a bias, it is on\nthe side of the First and Fourth Amendments.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: kschang@sfsuvax1.sfsu.edu (Kuo-Sheng (Kasey) Chang)\nSubject: Re: Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and HP DeskJet 500...\nOrganization: San Francisco State University\nLines: 29\n\nIn article <C64n5K.L45@vcd.hp.com> robertt@vcd.hp.com (Bob Taylor) writes:\n>Justin Whitton (ma90jjw%isis@ajax.rsre.mod.uk) wrote:\n>: In article <C60EKI.Kvp@vcd.hp.com> edmoore@vcd.hp.com (Ed Moore) writes:\n>: \n>:    thomas.d.fellrath.1@nd.edu@nd.edu wrote:\n>: \n>:    I think the ink now used in the DeskJet family is water-fast. \n>: \n>: I've had pictures ruined by a few drops of rain.

Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with\nhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined\nslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll\nhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've\nseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep\nthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact\nwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his\nchoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.\n   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a\nrelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful\nrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \"Why\nbe dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse\nto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to\ncome back.\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on\nwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I\ncould think of.\n   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going\nto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the\noutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and\nraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and\nin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was\nbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the\nallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not\nquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their\nrelationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung\nup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is\nthe first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if\nshe's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the\nbreak out in the open and done with.\n \n    I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;\nangry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for\npersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their\nchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my\nbrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us\nthat he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to\nappease an unappeasable,\nemotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;\nscared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will\nchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-\nrighteous over this bit of proof that they can't \"get away\" with treating\nus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even\nbeginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,\nsad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in\na horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or\nthey can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated\nbecause I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me\nup the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence,\nand vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not\nfree of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO*\nsomething, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting\nvices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal\nmental chatter enough to listen for God.)\n  Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is\nthis a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I\nconquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?\n \nHere's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long\npost: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and\ncharity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on\nmy own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him\nand can only wait and see what happens?

The yield goes to Heaven, and\n|> the waste is burned (destroyed) in Hell.  Why is it necessary to\n|> punish the waste, rather than just destroy it?\n \nLuke 16 talks about the rich man and Lazarus. Matthew 25 talks about \nthe eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations\n20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are\nthrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and\nthe fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where\na fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that\nthe devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the\nMatthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the\npunishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or\nin the sense of continual. \n \nFrom Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,\nif it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living\nforever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the \nunbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on\ncontinually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.\nIt definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid\nregardless of its exact nature. \n\nThere seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought:\nWhat is God's main plan on earth?\nWhy is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed\nto simply destroying completely those who refuse God?\n\nI believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship\nwith people.\n\nThe nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more\ndifficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something\nto avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has\nnothing to do with God.\n\nIn the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of\nhell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,\nit is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can\ncontinually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or\nwhether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is\nburned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a\nphysical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,\nat some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is\nno longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,\nthe unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell\ni.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical\npain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are\nto be forever without God. \n \nThe Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener\nthink in physical terms in order to get the point that some people\nwon't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of\nthe parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening\nto the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ.\nIt seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is\nnot even remotely pleasant.\n-- \nPeter White\ndisclaimer: None of what is written necessarily reflects \n     \t\t\ta view of my company.\n\tPhil    I want to know Christ and the power of his\n\t3:10 \tresurrection and the fellowship of sharing in\n\tNIV\t\this sufferings, becoming like him in his death\t\n"}, {"text": "From: pcollac@pyrnova.mis.pyramid.com (Paul Collacchi)\nSubject: Re: Braves & Giants: a case study of their weaknesses\nReply-To: pcollac@pyrnova.mis.pyramid.com (Paul Collacchi)\nDistribution: usa\nOrganization: Pyramid Technologies, Mt.

Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the\nmeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to\ndetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this\nknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough\nto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.\nTherefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\ncompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\nability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\nnot subject to the experimental method. \n\n?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n?\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\n?

Tate)\nSubject: MVP '92 Revisited\nKeywords: mlb, 04.20\nOrganization: Department of Industrial Engineering\nLines: 93\n\nTim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average\nstats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive\nperformances, compared to league average.  I've combined those with my\nposition-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total\nrun values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for\nreconsideration of the MVP award.\n\nMajor caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if\nSan Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the\ninfield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are\nposition-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and\ninflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do about\ncatchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions \nof Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  \n\nHaving said that, there are still some surprises.  Let's look National\nLeague first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.\n\n\tPlayer\t\tOffense\t\tDefense\t\tTotal\n\n\tSandberg\t  44\t\t  32\t\t 76\n\tBonds\t\t  67\t\t   3\t\t 70\n\tWalker\t\t  26\t\t  26\t\t 52\n\tJustice\t\t  14\t\t  33\t\t 47\n\tDaulton\t \t  44\t\t  ??\t\t 44+?\n\tLarkin\t\t  36\t\t   4\t\t 40\n\tGrace\t\t  13\t\t  27\t\t 40\n\nAs I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season.\nIf you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you\nget essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it\nwouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case.  Darren\nDaulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,\nand I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible.  A good case \ncould be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.\n\nMy personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.\n\n\nIn the American League:\n\n\tPlayer\t\tOffense\t\tDefense\t\tTotal\n\n\tVentura\t\t  22\t\t  34\t\t 56\n\tMartinez\t  47\t\t  -1\t\t 46\n\tB.

I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time\narguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only\napproximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, those\nof you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.\n\nOnce again, there's a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as\nimportant as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke\na guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that.\n\nMy personal vote (excluding pitchers):\n\n\tVentura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.\n\nI'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of\nbalanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher\nleverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with\nnegative defense.\n\nFor the record:\n\n\tCarlos Baerga\t\t  27\t\t  5\t\t  32\n\tRoberto Alomar\t\t  35\t\t -2\t\t  33\n\nForget it; it's a wash.\n\nLet me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding\nDon Mattingly's defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from his\nweak '90 and '91 to end up with\n\n\tMattingly\t\t  -1\t\t  17\t\t  16 runs\n\nwhich is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it's still 18 runs\nbehind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John\nOlerud.

The\nlocal oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via\nthe antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great\ncare.\n\nFor a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _Spy Catcher_.\nThe author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local\noscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for British\nIntelligence.\n\n  -Greg\n-- \n:::::::::::::::::::  Greg Andrews  gerg@netcom.com  :::::::::::::::::::\nFortune Cookie:  Radioactive cats have 18 half-lives.\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n"}, {"text": "Subject: Re: Who has read Rushdie's _The Satanic Verses_?\nFrom: sham@cs.arizona.edu (Shamim Zvonko Mohamed)\nOrganization: U of Arizona CS Dept, Tucson\nSummary: I have!\nLines: 58\n\nIn article <1r1cl7INNknk@bozo.dsinc.com> perry@dsinc.com (Jim Perry) writes:\n>Anyway, since I seem to be the only one following this particular line\n>of discussion, I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have\n>read this book?  What are your thoughts on it?  \n\nI read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name\non the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really\noffensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or\npublisher), and read it, \"cover to cover\" (to use a phrase that seems\npopular here right now).\n\nAnd I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but\nit was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie\ngrew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in\nNew Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the\nstrange constructions of Indian English: the \"yaar\" at the end of a\nsentence, \"Butbutbut,\" the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)\n\nAt the time I still \"sorta-kinda\" thought of myself as a muslim, and I\ncouldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this\nwas allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who\ntook on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as my\ngrandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; in\nshort, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to\nhave missed the point completely.  (And I won't mention the fact that the\nmost militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)\n\nPerhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it\nexposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity\nneed an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know that\nMuhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how\ndo we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, or\nput in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four\nwomen, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest\ninsult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to\nsuppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some \"holy\" guy. Not to\nmention murder the author.)\n\n>Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim\n>posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book\n>and had called it such things as \"filth and lies\", \"I would rank\n>Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse\", and so on.\n\nI had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really\nsilly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read \"Mein\nKampf?\" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don't they\njust read the book and decide for themselves?\n\nMaybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of\nprotest from the \"liberal\" muslims to Khomeini's fatwa outrage, was the\nfinal push I needed into atheism!\n\n-s\n--\n  Shamim Mohamed / {uunet,noao,cmcl2..}!arizona!shamim / shamim@cs.arizona.edu\n  \"Take this cross and garlic; here's a Mezuzah if he's Jewish; a page of the\n    Koran if he's a Muslim; and if he's a Zen Buddhist, you're on your own.\"\n   Member of the League for Programming Freedom - write to lpf@uunet.uu.net\n"}, {"text": "From: bressler@iftccu.ca.boeing.com (Rick Bressler)\nSubject: Re: Ban All Firearms !\nOrganization: Boeing Commercial Airplane Group\nLines: 21\n\nWoops.

You turn on\nyour computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it\ncools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles\nof this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics\nare much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact\nportable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function\nthat extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal\ncycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my\ncomputer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it\noff (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the\nphosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in\nthe computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue\nlife of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular\narchitecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :\") \n\nCharles Kuehmann\nNorthwestern University\nSteel Research Group\n"}, {"text": "From: ch981@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Tony Alicea)\nSubject: Re: Freemasonry and the Southern Baptist Convention\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH (USA)\nLines: 20\nReply-To: ch981@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Tony Alicea)\nNNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu\n\n\nIn a previous article, jluther@cs.umr.edu (John W.
