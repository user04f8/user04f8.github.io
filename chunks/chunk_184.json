And those of us who are fighting for the right to life\nof the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or\ncrime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God\nhas entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.\n\n\nTHE IMPRECATORY PSALMS\n\nEarly in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for\njudgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to\nrespond to them. Prayers such as:\n\"Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for\nhis wickedness ...\" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the\ngospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly\nmotivated by love for God (\"The Lord is King for ever and ever;\nthe nation will perish from His land\" 10:16, and \"Why does the\nwicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who\nsuffer (\"You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You\nencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the\nfatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,\nmay terrify no more.\" 10:17-18)\n\nNevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such\ngraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: \"Pour out your\nwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them\" 64:24; \"O\nLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O\nJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.\"\n95:1-2; \"Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them\nvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The\nrighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe\ntheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, \"Surely\nthe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who\njudges the earth.'\" 58:6-11\n\nCertainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply\ndestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray\nfor God to \"pour out His wrath\" on the wicked?\n\nThe scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be\nprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.\nRather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against\nHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these\nimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and\nwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who \"boast of evil\"\nand \"are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots\ndestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise\ndeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than\nspeaking the truth.\" 52:1-3; \"They crush your people ... They\nslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.\" 94:5-\n6; \"With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot\nagainst those You cherish.\" 83:3; \"You hate all who do wrong. You\ndestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the\nLord abhors.\" 5:5-6.\n\nTo those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:\n\"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin\" 52:5;\n\"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who\ngo on in their sins\" 68:21.\n\nAnd the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: \"Then\nit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...\"\n59:13; \"to proclaim the powers of God\" 68:34; \"All kings will bow\ndown to Him and all nations will serve Him \" 72:11; \"Who knows\nthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear\nthat is due You. \" 90:11\n\nYet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include\nimprecations (prayers invoking God's righteous judgement upon the\nwicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.\nHowever, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much\nmore common.\n\n\nPRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS\n\nAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I\nfound the survivors of communist persecution including the\ncrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to\nstrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.\nI was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven\npray \"How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge\nthe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?\" Revelation\n6:10).\n\nThe initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino\nNeto. Described as a \"drunken, psychotic, marxist poet\", Neto had\nbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.\nHe boasted that: \"Within 20 years there won't be a Bible or a\nchurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity.\" Yet\ndespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is\nnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.\nNeto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in\nMoscow.\n\nIn Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded\nof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:\n  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be\n     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.\n  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles\n     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be\n     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in\n     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was\n     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal\n     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.\n  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a\n     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car\n     crash the very next day.\n  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on\n     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to\n     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted\n     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,\n     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to\n     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded\n     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would\n     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against\n     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building\n     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.\n     \"They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord\n     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the\n     Lord spread widely and grew in power. \" Acts 19:17,20\n\nNicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the\npersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and\nexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of \"the\nantiChrist is dead\" in the streets. Many testified that this was\nin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of\nRomania.\n\nAnother persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora\nMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel\nwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in\nthe 1960's. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would\ndestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly\nMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in\nMozambique were closed confiscated, \"nationalised\" chained and\npadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,\nsome being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles\nwere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,\nincluding many pastors and elders, were shipped off to\nconcentration camps - most were never seen again.\n\nA month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly\nand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him\n(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were\nspecifically praying for God to stop the persecution in\nMozambique, Machel's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent\nthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa's\nboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans\nfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and\npublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,\nbut He had also saved a country from persecution.\n\nIn the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in\nZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27\nyear socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on\n31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to\nChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected\npresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian\ncountry.\n\nIt is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,\ndeclared trembling and in tears: \"I am more afraid of John Knox's\nprayers than of an army of ten thousand\".\n\nOn 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African\nCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented\ninternational wave of condolences and adulation reported one\ncould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a\nmartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ\nJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa\nthis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.\n\nThe stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people\nwere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective\nconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of\nthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other\nvictims. Indeed the SA government, the international community\nand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported\nover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans\nmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were\nunbanned!\n\nYet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,\nDeputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC's \"military\nwing\" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani\nhad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many\nunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: \"all who live by the sword\nwill die by the sword \" Matt 26:52.\n\nAfter personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities\nat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly\ndeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser\nArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs\nand limpet mines in public places during \"the struggle\") I told\nhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn't hate him, I did\nhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either\nbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God\nwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he\nwas an atheist.\n\nSeveral other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani\nto repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in\nAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against\nunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck\ndown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,\nwithin months of these public prayers for God to stop these\nkillers of preborn babies.\n\nSome praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:\n\"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror\nto evildoers \" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any\nChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -\neven of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory\nprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did\nour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).\n\nWhat then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?\nShould we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I\nwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, \"War\nPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory\nPsalms\" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and\nReformed Publishing Company):\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly\nin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the\nOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT\nare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50\ntimes. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.\n\n\n1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?\n\nSome Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as\n\"devilish\", \"diabolical \", \"unsuited to the church\", and \"Not God\n's pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of\na man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus'\nteaching that we should love our enemies. \"\n\nYet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:\n\"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,\nrebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the\nman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \"\n(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).\n\nThe fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our\ncomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its\ninspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil\nis to impudently take the place of God.\n\nDo we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God\nhave led many to become \"evangelic plastic surgeons who have made\nit their job to \"clean up\" God's Word according to their own\nideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone\nwho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for\nHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the\nauthority of God's Word (like Eve's original sin of listening to\nSatan's question \"Yes, hath God said... ?\").\n\nThe Psalms are part of God's revelation of Himself and His\nattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the\nauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these\nevangelical plastic surgeons reject as \"unsuited\" and \"unworthy\"\nfor the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about\nHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles\nused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb\n4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.\n\nCH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially\nPs 109):\n\"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage\nwhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in\njudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would\nspeak to us therein. \"\n\nThe rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of the\ngiver of that Word, God Himself.\n\n\n2. Who is praying these Psalms?\n\nChrist quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually\nspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an\nenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer\nbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at\nthe Last Supper.\n\nOn the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient\nauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own\nwords - the words of the Lord's Anointed - which as David's Son\nHe truly was.\n\"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit\" Ps 31:5\n\"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" Ps 22:1\n\nIn His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on\nthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!\nMatt 7:23 \"Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away\nfrom me, you evildoers'. \" Ps 6:8\n\nIn Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ\nalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said\nthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22\ndirectly to Christ despite there being no record of His having\nspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed\nChrist is speaking in the Psalms.\n\nChrist came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in\nall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again\nto execute Judgement on the wicked.\nDavid as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a\nprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:\n\"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the\nresurrection of Christ. \"\nDavid was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in\nhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah\nspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by\nChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His\nforerunner David.\n\nThe imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of\nGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion\nfor the wronged.\n\n\n3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?\n\nChrist is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for\nour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with\nthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for\nwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the\nsubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah\n53).\n\n\"God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we\nmight become the righteousness of God. \" 2 Cor 5:21\n\nIn history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have\nbeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St\nAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.\nAll the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the\nimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord\nJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is\nonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy\nHis enemies.\n\nThese prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of\nKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God's Word is revealed\nupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God's way of\nforgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses\nof God.\n\nHe who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a\nreality when He declares to those on His left:\n\"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared\nfor the devil and his angels. \" Matt 25:41\n\nAll the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God's\nKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone\nwill reign forever!\n\"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a\nsharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule\nthem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of\nthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \"\nRev 19 : 15\n\n\n4. Are Jesus' prayers contradictory?\n\nWhat about Jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless those\nwho curse us (Matt 5:44)?\n\nChrist is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives\nsin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement\non those who disobey His Gospel.\n\n\"God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you\nand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when\nthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His\npowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel\nof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting\ndestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from\nthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in\nHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have\nbelieved. \" 2 Thess 1:6-10\n\nJesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on\nearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see\nboth the vengeance and the love ot God.\n\nEven in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.\n\"Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of\ngreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You\nbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? \"\nMatt 23\n\nIn Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His\nbetrayal by Judas.\n\nWe also need to acknowledge that Christ's prayers of blessing are\nnot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only\npraying to the elect of God - those who have:\n\"obeyed your Word\"... \"accepted\" God's Word ... and have\n\"believed \". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the\nmessage of God's kingdom will be judged.)\n\n\n5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?\n\nMartin Luther pointed out that when one prays: \"Hallowed be Thy\nName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done \" then \"he must put all\nthe opposition to this in one pile and say: 'Curses, maledictions\nand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May\nthey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and\nwisdom and plans run aground' . \"\n\nTo pray tor the extension of God's kingdom is to solicit the\ndestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: \"The God of\nheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it\nwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it\nwill itself endure forever. \"\n\n* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for\nthe kingdom of darkness. *\n\nThere is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church\ncannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God's\nkingdom. God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom being\ndestroyed. God's will cannot be done on earth without the\ndestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of\nevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism\nwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights\nof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.\n\nNote Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who \"plot\ntogether\" against God and His people:\n\"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O\nLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and\nJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like\nrefuse on the ground. \"\n\nThe story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)\nprovides a vivid example of God's judgement on the wicked. Sisera\n\"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years\" and they\n\"cried to the Lord for help\" Judges 4:3. In response to those\nprayers: \"The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by\nthe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...\nAll the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. \"\nJudges 4:15-16\n\nThe account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the\ntent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety\nand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The\nsong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of\nthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is\nthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. \"As\nyou did to Sisera ...\"\n\n\n6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience\n\nThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:\n     \"If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,\n     which are written in this book, and do not revere this\n     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord\n     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He\n     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you\n     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also\n     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not\n     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are\n     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...\n     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be\n     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \"\n     Deuteronomy 28:58-63\n\nThe covenant God made with His people included curses for\ndisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27\nrecords the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in\nan awesome account:\n\"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud\nvoice:\n\"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing\ndetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - and\nsets it up in secret. \"\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \"\n\"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...\n\"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone...\n\"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...\n\"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the\nfatherless or the widow...\n\"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...\n\"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent\nperson.\n\"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by\ncarrying them out.\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Deut 27:14-26\n\nThe New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of\nrejecting Christ is the curse. \"If anyone does not love the\nLord - a curse be on him. \" 1 Corinthians 16:22\n\n(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-\n31; 12:14-29.)\n\n\n7. How can we preach these prayers?\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.\nScripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-\nin-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on\nthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we\nexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the\ntroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the\nstrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not\nhear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him\nonto the battlefield?\n\nPastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church's\nCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job\nis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain\nand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders.\nThe pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of a\ncourier in any earthly army. There's no place tor the dispatcher\nto decide he doesn't agree with his Commander's strategy.\n\nWhen Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching\nmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom (Lk\n10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God's\nrule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on\nany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected\nit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we\nmust consider what He said they should do if their message were\nrejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against\nGod's rule - \"But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go\ninto its 'streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town that\nsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:\nThe kingdom of God is near\"' Luke 10:11.\n\nWhat would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it\nwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent\nfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that\ntown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,\nBethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message\n(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great\nauthority He had given them: \"He who listens to you listens to\nMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects\nhim who sent Me \" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor\ncalling down God's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion\nagainst God's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of\nHis servants.\n\nWe need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the\nPrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its\nlethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on\nthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks\nwill be inevitable.\n\nLike Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of\nobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is\nthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he\nreap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in\nDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings\n6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant\nbreakers is real.\n\nThe \"I\" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The \"we\" of the Psalms\nincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our\nown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The\nPsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record\nChrist's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As\nChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final\nfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will\nanswer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the\nfinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when\nHe will say: \"But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be\nKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me\"\nLuke 19:27.\n\nA fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to\nobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war\npsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God's\nkingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by\nthe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local\ncongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your\nbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including \"the sword\nof the Spirit, which is the Word of God \" Eph 6:17. That battle-\nreadiness also involves \"pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions\nwith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.\n\nChrist teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the\nenemies of God as the psalmist did: \"Pour out Your wrath on the\nnations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not\ncall on Your Name\" Ps 79:6.\n\nTo deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it\nis necessary for us to pray for God's justice. Those who are\npersecuted need the comfort of these prayers.\n\n\"Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the\npraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in\ntheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment\non the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles\nwith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against\nthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. \" Ps\n149:5-9\n\nPrayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for\nconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement\non those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army\nof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He\nhas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people\nnf God to destroy evil.\n\nIf you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or\nundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword\nanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of\nJesus - until \"the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as\nthe waters cover the sea\" Hab 2:14.\n\nThe full book \"War Psalms of the Prince of Peace \" is available,\nat R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.\n\n\nPERMISSION TO REPRODUCE\nThose wishing to reproduce or quote from any edition of FF News\nare encouraged to do so.

Some of them are very serious\nwhile others are completely benign.  Having \"a few irregular beats\"\non an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and\nwhen they occurred, or could be of no significance.\n\nLow blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying\nheart disease to develop arrhythmias.

She was a cheerful\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\n    on\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\n    Eucharist.\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\trest  of  the\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\n    until\n\n\t\t\t\t   -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.\n\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\tMaria\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\n    did the Holy Will of God.\n\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\ttwice\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\tlived\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\n\n\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\n    handkerchief,\"  as\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\n    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\ttouch\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\n    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.\n\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\t\"No I\n    will  not,\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\n    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\n    of the baby Teresa\ton  the  landing  brought  the\tattention  to\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\n\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\taway.\n    As\tthe  ambulance\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr.

For the\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\n    in\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\n    died at about three o'clock.\n\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\n    in\tMaria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.

So far, Israe \ncontinues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they \nleave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that \nthe only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a\nreduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....\nand in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTim: \n\nThere seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The\nfirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so\nthere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in \nexchange for pieces of paper, \"expectations\", \"hopes\", etc. The second\nis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that\nthese \"tangible concessions\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving\nanything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances\nseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns\nfor its expected concessions. By \"tangible\" is meant something that\n1) provides Israel with \"comparable\" protection (from the land it is to \ngive up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine \n**will be** accountable and held actively (not just \"diplomatically) \nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens \nor \"visitors\").\n\nIn essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel\nwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** \nco-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel \nfrom its territory.\n\tAside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,\n\thow *could* such \"guarantees\" be instilled? For example,\n\thow could such \"guarantees\"/\"controls\" be added to the\n\tPalestinian PISGA proposals?\n\nIsrael is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute\nit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \"buffer zone\", gives\nfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties\ncould (and *would*, if not \"controlled\" somehow) EASILY return to the \ntraditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*\nensure that that will not happen.\n\nTim\n\n"}, {"text": "From: apodaca@spot.Colorado.EDU (mu'tafikah)\nSubject: Re: DID HE REALLY RISE???\nOrganization: University of Blaspheme\nLines: 20\n\nI don't understand who this post is directed towards; who are you\ntrying to convince?

In fact,\n>it doesn't mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.\n\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\npositive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\n\n>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;\n>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with\n>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score\n>tied, for another .22.  And, finally, in the ninth to win the game by a score\n>of 7-6, for a value of 0.5.  Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances, and\n>was credited by your method with .12 + .14 + .22 + .5 = .98.  But what does\n>that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense\n>is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn't\n>pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not\n>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say\n>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,\n>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have\n>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There's clearly a problem here.\n\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\nThus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\nthe pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \n\n\n\n>>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\n>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\n>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.\n>\n>In another article, I proposed a test of this.

If\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\n\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \n\n>Here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\n>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\n>\n>Does this make sense?\n\n\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\nwould win.\n \nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\ngoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\n\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\n\n                                                        Brian Smith\n"}, {"text": "From: kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com (John C. King)\nSubject: Wanted: Riverbank Pub.

For me, my greatest fears\nin this area would be the following:\n\n1--that the people would be misled\n2--that people would lose respect for christianity\n3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies\n4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word,\n   my calling would be lost forever.

Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but\n   I could never again be a prophet of God.\n\nIn the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak\nand that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the\nworld of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate,\ncowardly silence or by our false statements.  And because of this, it\nis critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, and\nin prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference.\n\nIn this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging\none another, claiming \"rights\" that are not theirs, denying rights that do\nindeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the \"gods\" of this\nworld, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel\ngood.\n\nIt's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in\ncontrast against this backdrop of falsehood.  When we say, \"thus sayeth the\nLord\", it happens.  When we pray, prayer is answered because we prayed right.\nWhen we say we're christians, we really mean it.\n\n           Dan\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n\t We must reach the root of the evil...\n\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n\t from the dreadful deed...\n\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n\t\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n\t\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n\t\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"\n\n\t\t- Susan B.

Most readers of the newsgroup don't \nwant to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure \nfrom tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Hitler was an atheist!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\n\nResponse:\n\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno \"cost\".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\nit he says:\n\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task...\"\n\nEinstein has also said:\n\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it.\"\n\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me.\"\n\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God.\"\n\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?\"\n\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists.\"\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\n(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\n \n EM: \"It's bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\n \n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\n\n EM: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\nhis original statement, and wrote:\n\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government.\"\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!

It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.\n\n\nEnd of FAQ Digest\n*****************\n\u00ff\n"}, {"text": "From: walsh@optilink.COM (Mark Walsh)\nSubject: Re: Age of Consent == Child Molestation\nOrganization: Optilink Corporation, Petaluma, CA\nLines: 40\n\nIn article <C4tz28.Cpp@panix.com> roy@panix.com (Roy Radow) writes:\n>In <15148@optilink.COM> walsh@optilink.COM (Mark Walsh) writes:\n\n##It should be noted that NAMBLA has not been present in the\n##other 600 or so gay parades in the nation.

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \"The Last\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n"}, {"text": "From: howard@Metaphor.COM (Lee Howard)\nSubject: Re: My Gun is like my American Express Card\nReply-To: howard@Metaphor.COM (Lee Howard)\nOrganization: m4\nLines: 25\n\nIn article <C59BIE.4zL@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca>, papresco@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca (Paul Prescod) writes:\n|> In article <1993Apr8.193321.12753@anasazi.com> john@anasazi.com (John R.

It\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\nVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\n\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\nwhat you think.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n----------\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\nother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\nto a real lawyer.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n---------------------\n\n1)  What is RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\n the intended recipient.)\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\n file:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\n friend.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\n\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can\n use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\n must have come from the sender.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\n multiple encryption with DES.\n\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.\n\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\n same length, etc.\n\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n11)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\n   PGP 2.0.)\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.  \n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\n   in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\n shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\n\n12)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\n\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\n\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n13)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\n the matter.\n\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\n\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and\n what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main \"weak area\" is\n probably key distribution.\n"}, {"text": "From: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nSubject: The genocide of 204,000 Azeri people by Armenians between 1988-1992.\nReply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nDistribution: world\nLines: 172\n\nIn article <30930@galaxy.ucr.edu> raffi@watnxt08.ucr.edu (Raffi R Kojian) writes:\n\n>The treatment of Armenians by Azeri's equals the treatment Bosnian \n>Muslims are  getting from the Bosnian Serbs.  \n\nThat is the result of living in an alternate universe with 'Arromdians'\nof the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle.

This is not arrogance --\n> it is just an inescapable fact.\n\nYes, there are these two senses of interpretation, and certainly our\ndecision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own\nprivate opinion.  However, when reading Scripture, we have to remember\nthat the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction, and that\nthe interpretation that matters is the one God intended.  For example,\nif I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the\ndoctrine of reincarnation, I am wrong because that is not the intended\ninterpretation.  The prophets didn't make up this teaching; it came\nfrom God, and we must accept it as such.  This necessarily means that\nour private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God\nintended to convey.  Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to\ndetermine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make us\nrecognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically\naccepted as the infallible interpretation of God.  We need to test the\nspirits to see if they are from God.  When the Holy Spirit speaks, he\nsays the same thing to all; he won't tell me that a passage means one\nthing and tell you it means another.  If the two of us come to\nconflicting conclusions, we can't both be completely right.  We know\nour interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a whole\nagrees on what Scripture means.  This is how we know the doctrines of\nthe Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, etc. infallibly.  These\nmatters are not up for private interpretation.\n\nThis is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of\nthe false teachers.  They preferred their own private interpretation\nto the God-given teaching of the apostles.  It is through such private\ninterpretation that the traditions of men, so soundly denounced in\nScripture, are started.\n\nTony\n"}, {"text": "From: jbatka@desire.wright.edu\nSubject: Re: Gamma Ray Bursters.

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican\nLibrary as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of\nRome as a political and scholarly superpower during the\nRenaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson\nBuilding of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through\nApril 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by\nanonymous FTP indefinitely.\n\n     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican\nLibrary, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &\nBiology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came\nto Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each\nsection consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit\ndirectory and contains the exhibit text for that section and\nseparate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit\nincludes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,\nbut also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if\nthere were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items\nomitted later in the planning process.\n\n     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance\nscholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of\nscience or medicine, early music scholars, students of the\nhumanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,\ntheologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and\nto librarians and information professionals.
