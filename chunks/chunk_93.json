In the examples I've seen, drugs were\ndefinitely involved. \n\nMy own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the\nhospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate\nmedications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling\nus that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if\nhe was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With\nthe help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication\ndiscontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug.\nTwo days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many\nmedical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.\n\nI don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an\naspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe\nthat, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to\ntake your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces\nthe chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care\nproviders can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those\ncircumstances. \n\nI grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless, I suggest\nyou procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss\nit with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL\nat all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have been\nprescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because the\nhospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly.\n\nJust my opinion,\n\n-Larry (obviously not a doc) C.\n\n  \n"}, {"text": "From: f_gautjw@ccsvax.sfasu.edu\nSubject: Re: Janet Reno on Nightline\nDistribution: na\nOrganization: Stephen F.

If you want\nless quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable\nyou could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This\nrequires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could\nprobably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply\ninstruction and a few other DSP things.\n\nIf you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a\nsecond (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000\n8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1\ncompression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about\nV.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.\nNow add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need\nsampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a\nPC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap\n- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the\nSoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't\nsample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation\na bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be\nrequired.\n\nThe only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the\nSoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that\nI don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't\nestimate how fast a PC you'd need.\n\n\n-- \nNot all men who drink are poets.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is\nalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)\n\nI've been working at this company for eight years in various\nengineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that\non seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this\ncompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\n\nI'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\n\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\n\n\t- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\n\t- someone's sick idea of flirting\n\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\n\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\nme some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\n\nI can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the\noffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\nwants to do to my body.\n\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\nleft in my desk drawer.\n\nI need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\nthat it's ridiculous.\n\nI feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel\nlike I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple\nphone call saying \"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so\nthat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\"\n\nPlease pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously\nturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing\nme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\nisn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\ndo me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\n\nAnd please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this.\nThat's my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you're not worth\nanyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\", \"you're right,\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\ncompany so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\n\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God.\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\nGod, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\nseparate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his\nloving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the\nhand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding\non to me.)\n\nAlthough this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup,\nI really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this\nreason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After\nall, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall\ntopics.\n\nThanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.

(email: fw@world.std.com)\nMy thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from\nOracle Corp.\n\nThe most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit \nfeatures or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$\nincluded suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to \nuse table views to refine the granularity of access control.\n\nOne important security consideration in networked installations\nis that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user\nauthentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the \n_least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably \nnot define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access \nof OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle \nservers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv\noption), while relying on host security for local processes. \n\nInternally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) \naudit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and\ndata access. These tools can be used to track the primary security\nrisks from within the Oracle environment.\n\nOracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES\nencryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone\nto cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate \nsince the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users \nchoose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access \nto your oracle database files through the host operating system, \ns/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply \ncryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.\n\nAs security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.\nCertainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,\ns/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break \nthe passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without\nalerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail\nwhich would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)\nprovides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not \nguessable. \n\nAs with all computer security, the most important defense is to \neducate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques\nare well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, \n(both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System \nSecurity (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992) \n\n\n\nForrest Whitcher                 fw@world.std.com\nBoston Scientific Corp.

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\nstandoff ensued.\n\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\ninsane.\n\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\nagents against the compound.\n\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\n\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\nimplementation of the decision.\n\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\n\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\n\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\ncircumstances.\n\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\nhas been learned now.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\nafter 51 days, you decided --\n\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\nwith --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\nfirst and then the other.\n\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\ncan't do it at once.\n\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\n\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\n\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\nI was given were the following:\n\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\nneeded in other parts of the country.\n\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\nmembers to come out.\n\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\nthe passage of time.\n\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\nunsafe conditions.\n\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\nincrease with the passage of time.\n\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\nsignificance.\n\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\ntoday.\n\n     Q  Mr. President --\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\nto unfold.\n\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\n\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\n\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\nchildren.\n\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\n\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\ndecide that way?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\nevidence we have.\n\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\n\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\njust began to spin downward.\n\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\nThat's what they thought.\n\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\nhave gas masks?\n\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\nyou in agreement with that?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\ncountry.\n\n   (more, more)\n -30-\n"}, {"text": "From: christen@astro.ocis.temple.edu (Carl Christensen)\nSubject: 8 cards on a 6 card motherboard?\nOrganization: Temple University\nLines: 16\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.ocis.temple.edu\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\nThis may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a\nway to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)\nto get the usual 8?

And oh, did that ever stir up a\nstorm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members\nfind it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house\ncommittees.  \"Security secrets\" are liable to fall into their hands...\n\nThis attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism,\nbeing so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holds\nthat there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens\nof thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body\nwhich represents the people of Israel.  We are not speaking here of\npolitical discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but\nof racial discrimination.  The proof: one of the compromises proposed\nwas that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar\nGojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party.  It was not the member's\nparty which was considered unfit, but his race...\n\n[* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *]\n\nIt is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding, a\npublic debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following\narticle:\n\n\nA TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE\n\nBy Gid'on Levi, Ha'aretz, July 26, 1992\n\nRevelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral\npart of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal\nwith them.  [Do you hear that, -----?  Please contact this Levi fellow\nand explain to him how little he knows about Israel.  Please! - Yigal].\nExcept that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's\nwindow dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious.\n\nLast week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is\nfinding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more\nimportant committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less\ndifficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories.  Seemingly\ntwo entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same.\n\nThe 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its\nmembers are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least\non one issue.  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and\nparliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition\nendures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees\nof the house.  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the\nExternal Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee.\nWorlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not \"to\ngive\" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller's\nCommittee.\n\nThe arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above\ncommittees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an\nArab should hear them.  One must not make light of such arguments, but\ntheir significance should also not be exaggerated.  Every Arab MK is not\nspending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over\ninformation from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther\nheadquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are\ncontinually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which\ncould safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the Jewish\nUnderground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even from\nHadash.\n\nThe Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee\non Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MK\nNawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Minister\nin an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or even\na review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularly\nleaked to the next edition of the news.  And what would happen if MK\nHashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at\nal-Najah?\n\nTheir non-participation [in important committees] and that of their\ncolleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of the\nelected house have only semi-positions.  They are good enough for\naddressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the\ngovernment and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and\nAbsorption Committee.  But they must not, for example, participate in\nthe process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or\nin the allocation of resources to local authorities.  In any case, they\nhave little part in that.\n\nLabor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about\nsome improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the\nState Comptroller's Committee.  Earlier, there had been a ridiculous\nattempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be,\nand thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies,\nbut it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional\nbacking for such a step.\n\nBut not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices.  The\nnew Committee Chair, Roni Milo, has already announced that he will set up\nsubcommittees aplenty for his committee.  Thus he will decide where it\nis permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not.  A solution\nsuch as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest of\nthe committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets\nbeing leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from\nthe Knesset.\n\n[. . .]\n\nEnd Article\n\nDo you accept that as documentation?\n\nJoseph Askew\n\n-- \nJoseph Askew, Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness, see the Pleiades,\njaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts, fell the grief.\nDisclaimer?

Remove the ball, and inside you should see\n(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of\ncaked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully\nscrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*\nYou do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.\nPut the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  \n\nI clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom\nis that when you move the mouse, it seems to \"click\" along.  If this\ndoesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.

We \nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\n\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \nrepeated blasts.\n\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\n\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains \nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\n\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\n\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\n\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \nmortis. They had been shot.\n\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh?

The non-Jewish world ha\n    never regarded any form of Jewish suffering important, except\n    when the Jews were the models of the powerless victim holding\n    the high moral ground, as it had been just after World War 2.  \n    However, as soon as the Jewish people started to take care of \n    themselves, the ancient hatred of Jews was unleashed again.  \n    \n    I doubt if the non-Jewish world is even capable of having any\n    compassion towards Jews as anti-semitism is so ancient and so\n    basic to both Christianity and Islam.  \n    \n    Golda Meir said that there would be peace when the Arabs love\n    their own children more than they hate the Jews.  And while I\n    know that there are more Arab parents who love their children \n    than those who would send their children out into the streets \n    to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns,\n    the world is so obsessed by a hatred of Jews trying to defend \n    themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of \n    those parents who not simply allow their children to do this, \n    but encourage them to throw themselves into harm's way.  Even \n    Arab children are expendable, if their tragic deaths are used \n    in the neverending propoganda battle to blame Israel, and the  \n    Jews, for any misfortune befalling Arabs in the middle east.\n\n\n\n        *       *       *       *       *       *       *          \n   Who is a Jew?
