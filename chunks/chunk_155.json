I think it would severely diminish the \nnumber of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic\nploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).\n\n>2.

I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the 'f' key,\neh?  Obviously, from what I wrote above, I like this idea.\n\n>The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows\n>the runner to \"challenge\" pitcher to throw over to the base.\n\nIt may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the \npitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner,\nso he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of \nsound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness\nthat could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some\ndisadvantages to that idea too.\n\n>|> Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours\n>|> in the AL.  That's just too damn long.

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of\naspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise,\nsince you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other\ncomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administration\nof high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable.\nMethanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings,\nsay 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde\nand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels\ncan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses\nthe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one\ntreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on\nethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is\nmetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver.\nIf the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde,\nit is actually relatively non-toxic.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n"}, {"text": "From: boyle@cactus.org (Craig Boyle)\nSubject: Re: Opel owners?\nOrganization: Capital Area Central Texas UNIX Society, Austin, Tx\nLines: 45\n\nIn article <C5t3B2.DG@news.cso.uiuc.edu> cka52397@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (OrioleFan@uiuc) writes:\n>boyle@cactus.org (Craig Boyle) writes:\n>\n>>In article <C5sxI4.J9B@news.cso.uiuc.edu> cka52397@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (OrioleFan@uiuc) writes:\n>>>gibbonsa@fraser.sfu.ca (Darren Gibbons) writes:\n>>>>I'm looking for information on Opel cars.

The directory entry, the FAT chain,\nand the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined\nnotebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.\n\nThe directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,\nand first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not\nimportant right now.\n\nThe File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find\nthe actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the\nnumber is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it\nholds a \"magic\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad\n(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster\ncontains the next section of the file.\n\nThe data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.\nThe data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is\ndoled out in \"chunks\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster\nis 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.\n\nTo read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the\nstarting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.\nNext, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will\ntell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.\nNaturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump\naround and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a\ntime, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker\nwhich says it's the last cluster in the file.\n\nCHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of\nthe directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into\nsubmission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to\ndouble-check anything it \"fixes\".\n\nNow let's do a bit of a post-mortem:\n\n>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\CVPIC.EXE\n>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VPIC.TXT\n>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VIDEO7.CFG\n>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\ORCPRO2.CFG\n>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VGA.CFG\n>C:\\GAME\\GOOSE\\BIRD2.X\n>C:\\WINMISC\\ADV21\\WINADV.EXE\n>   Allocation error, size adjusted\n\nAll of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match\nthe size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter\nthe directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the\ndirectory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.\nBut CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,\nobviously, are made up.))\n\n>   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains.\n>    647168 bytes disk space would be freed\n\nDisk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached\nto any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these\n\"lost chains\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK\nthrough FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell\nCHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply\nbe marked \"available\" in the FAT.\n\n\n>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\CVPIC.EXE\n>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133\n\n...\n\n>C:\\386SPART.PAR\n>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133\n\nThese files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,\none of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that\nC:\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...\n\nTo fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.\nThis will \"fix\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.\nNow delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to\nassemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \"Missing pieces\" are\nlikely to be found in those \"lost chains\" at the top...)\n\n>  42366976 bytes total disk space\n>   3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files\n>    153600 bytes in 67 directories\n>  36042752 bytes in 1496 user files\n>   1564672 bytes available on disk\n\nYour disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of\nthe problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an\namount which exceeded available disk space...\n\nIn any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.\nThere are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage\nafter something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the\nproblem occurs.  Sorry.\n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------\nGordon S.

It's much\nstronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of\n160 bits.  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first\nstandardized, a simple double encryption would not have the same\nstrength.  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less\nthe beginning to encrypt other keys.  It's recommended for anything of\nvery high value.  And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit\nthat description.\n\nWhy n_1, n_2, and n_3?  Well, you need different plaintext values.  I\nhave no idea if they'll be disclosed or not.  At a guess, they're\nconstructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible.\nA goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change\n-- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit\npatterns, and there might, conceivably, be a weakness.  So the n_i\nvalues are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming\ndistance.\n\nIn any event, I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_i\nfrom the U_i, let alone U.  (Observe:  if the NSA has U, they don't\nneed to find S_i.  But even if they do, they can't get U_1 and U_2.  In\ntheory, they should never even see those values, even with a warrant.)\n\nThe real question, I think, is why use this scheme at all, as opposed\nto a hardware random number generator.  My answer is that this is\n*much* more verifiable.  Look -- suppose that NSA, NIST, the ACLU, the\nEFF, and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random number\ngenerator, and that it passed every test you could think of.  When you\ncome back next week to program some more chips, does it still work that\nwell?  Have any components changed in value?  Have the components been\nchanged out from under you?  Does it still work well the in the\npresence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards\nselecting 1 bits?  Yes, you can run detailed statistical tests on it\nagain, but that's hard.\n\nConsider, on the other hand, a software solution.  You bring your own\nfloppies with you, you can run cryptographic checksums, etc.  It's a\nlot easier to verify that the software is unchanged, in other words.\n(Yes, I can think of ways to cheat software, too.  I think that they're\na lot harder.)\n\nThere are three issues with Clipper.  The first is whether or not the\narchitecture of the whole scheme is capable of working.  My answer,\nwith one significant exception, is yes.  I really do think that NSA and\nNIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be, assuming that\ntheir real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping, under\ncertain carefully-controlled circumstances, with a minimum risk of\nabuse.  (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip, on a\nprogramming diskette.  That's seriously wrong.  U_1 and U_2 should be\nloaded onto the chip separately.)  To those who disagree (and I don't\nclaim my answer is obvious, though I found my own reasoning\nsufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions\nsection of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the\nscheme), I issue this invitation:  assume that you were charged with\nimplementing such a system, with complete regard for civil rights and\ndue process.  What would you do differently?  In answering this\nquestion, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions:  that both\nstrong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap\n*some* domestic users, is necessary.  (If you feel it necessary to\nchallenge those assumptions, do it in the context of the last issue I\npresent below.  Right here, I'm discussing *just* the technical\naspects.  And no, I don't by any means claim that just because\nsomething can be done, it should be.)\n\nThe second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually\ngoing to be used.  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't\nmean that that's the only way they'll be made.  Maybe the NSA will\nsubstitute its own chips between the programming facility and the\nshipping dock.  And they'll generate bogus warrant requests, so that\nthe escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called.  (``Sorry,\nguys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have\nbought triple-DES phones instead.  Who'd 'a' thunk it?'')  I have no\nanswer to this question, and at the moment, I don't see a way of\nanswering it.  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer\nto the final question, below.\n\nThe third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good\nidea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.\nI think that the answer is no, but it's not a no-brainer.  I'm a civil\nlibertarian, not a libertarian, for reasons that I explained at great\nlength on the net in the Elder Days, and that I don't have the energy\nto repeat now.  But that means that I'm willing to accept that some\nlaws are necessary, so long as they respect the essential rights of\nindividuals.  The government already has the ability and -- in our\nsystem -- the right to issue search warrants, and while that power has\ncertainly been abused, it's also been used quite properly and fairly in\nother cases.  Is key escrow sufficiently different?  I think so -- but\nagain, it's not an easy question for me.  (It is easy for libertarians\nto answer, of course, since Clipper is completely alien to much of the\nrest of their (oft-admirable) philosophy.  And it's also easy for those\nwho give their unreserved trust to government, a group I'm much more\ndistant from.)\n\n\n\t\t--Steve Bellovin\n"}, {"text": "From: dpeterik@iastate.edu (Dan Peterik)\nSubject: Re: Brewer Notes\nOrganization: Iowa State University, Ames IA\nLines: 26\n\nIn <30MAR93.02086551.0010@MUSIC.LIB.MATC.EDU> PFAN <PFAN@MUSIC.LIB.MATC.EDU> writes:\n\n>For those of you who know who Bernie Brewer is, he's back.

If you will study the word, you will see\nthat it signifies \"separation.\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is\nthe reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one\nmember of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  \n\nI once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. \nShe was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my\n\"girlfriend\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were\nseparated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided\nthat she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was\ndeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is\nseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not\nbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go\nthere.  \n\n>> did you know that Jesus talked more\n>> about hell than He did about heaven!  \n\n>Thank you for this info.

He\nwas trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued\non my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and\nunloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us\ndo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. \nYou have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to\nyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  \n\n>Being Jesus was allegedly God, I doubt he could honestly feel\n>     the pinpricks man dealt him...\n\nThis may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct\nknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.\n Jesus most certainly felt the \"pinpricks\" of life.  As the Scripture say:\n\nHeb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our\nweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without\nsin.\n\nThe kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes\nwhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine\nto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \"The Consciousness of\nChrist.\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this\ninteresting study, including clh.  \n\nIt is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually\nsuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we\ndo.  He \"grew in knowledge.\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose\nto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \"led of the Spirit\" to such\nan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and\nJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,\nthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. \nThat is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was\nliving sequential history as you or I.  \n\nMaybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion\nand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than\nnot.\n\n>Thanks again for the info.  Just so you know, some friends and I\n>     are starting a Freethinkers organization-- and I'm going to\n>     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro-\n>     duction... :-)\n\nI was once a member of that club.  THe \"free thinker\" is a glorious ideal.  By\ncontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository\nof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find\nsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist\nwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. \nBut what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \"rational\ndoubt\" when in fact he was led to it by his \"faith\".  He must acknowledge that\nwhile it is rational doubt for him as a \"free thinker\" to criticize the\nChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize\nhim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no\nfaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.\n\nPascal pointed out that \"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.\n Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\"  The fact that skeptics are not\nskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must\nbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or\neven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a\nmeasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define\nhimself only in negative terms, hence the term \"a\"-theist.\n\nSome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In\nmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. \nHowever, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,\nevery point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication\nspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make\nsense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.\n\nThat is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism\nis arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \"Look, your fly\nis undone!\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he\nbelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it\nunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he\nknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. \nThe answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on\npresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before\nit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and\ncritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective\nand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  \n\nPresuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is\nsomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can\nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are\nour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for\nabsence.\n\n>  I tell you what-- if God condemns me for being honest, He is\n>    unworthy of my worship.  Better to burn in Hell than to\n>     serve a tyrant in Heaven..\n\nOf course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had\nbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \"Highlander\" movie. \nBut again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of\nGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic\ntheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His\nprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you\nare to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct\nunderstanding of Himself.\n\n--Rex\n"}, {"text": "From: behanna@syl.nj.nec.com (Chris BeHanna)\nSubject: Re: Ed must be a Daemon Child!!\nOrganization: NEC Systems Laboratory, Inc.\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 33\n\nIn article <bethdC5JuL2.L9@netcom.com> bethd@netcom.com (Beth Dixon) writes:\n>In article <1993Apr14.133413.1499@research.nj.nec.com> behanna@syl.syl.nj.nec.com (Chris BeHanna) writes:\n>>In article <bethdC5G0H6.I48@netcom.com> bethd@netcom.com (Beth Dixon) writes:\n>>>Bzzzzt.

Affected programs include rgb and \nthe server.\n\n\tThis is from the GCC manual:\n\n\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \n\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\n\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \n\treference.\n\n\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\n\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.\n\n\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\n\t`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.\n\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \ncompilation flags.  \n\n\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\n\t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \n\t\trgb/rgb.c\n\n\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or\nreturn values:  \n\t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \n\t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \nharmless as they don't involve structs.\n\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \n\t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \n\tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\n\n\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do \nthis simple test:\n\n\t#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n\tSIOCGIFCONF\n\nRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of \ninterest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like \nwhitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your \nfixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc\nsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are \nidentical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make \nsure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  \n\n[courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?\nIn mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \"missing\" defines for \nCG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN.

While \nbuilding and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid \nlinking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those \ndistributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  \nIf you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that \nthe shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or \n/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked \nstatically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\n\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\nmost C compilers).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt?

It wasn't documented and was \nremoved in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5\nlibraries only applied to the documented interface).  \n\nA workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4\nor OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.\n\n[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis \n(jpf@heliocentric.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\n\n\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)\nrunning under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using \nshared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\n\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system\nadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used\nby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security \nproblems at your site.\n\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\n\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths\nto the libraries.\n\n[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]\n\nThe R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the\nnewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid\nprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this \nmay cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. \nXload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\n\n\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits \nanyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by \naccessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps\nmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console \ndisplay.

Although it is not \nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\n\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \nobvious.\n\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\nR5 versions are different.\n\n\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\n\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\nusing Imake to build X\n\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\n\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4\nguide to imake.\n\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\nFulton on an early version of Imake\n\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\nmail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\n\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\n\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make \n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX \nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\n\t- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on\ndemystifying Imake.\n\t- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in \nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\n\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\n\n\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\n\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\n\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\n\n\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a \nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XShapeQueryExtension\n\t_XShapeCombineMask\n\n\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\n\n\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \nlibraries.\n\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \nerror \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\n\n\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that \nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\nbe called.\n\n\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \n\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\n\t2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \n\n\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\n\t\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \n11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3.

In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\n\n\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\ncan use something like the following:\n\n        XWMHints wmhints;\n        ...\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\n        wmhints.input = True;\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\n\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.\n\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \nthis done. \n\n\tIf you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\n\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\n\n\tYou can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\nspoofed in any case. \n\tFor most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so \nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \nmanager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\n\t\n\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]\n\n\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\n\n\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\n\t{\n\tArg args[3];\n\tint i;\n\tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */\n\ti=0;\n\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\n\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\n\t...\n\t}\n\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.\n[11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\n\n\tYou're probably trying to use these functions from application code.\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\n\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \nwidgets' data becoming corrupted.\n\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \navoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\n\n\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\nthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\nWhat should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \ncreating a new widget.\n\n\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

The crucial\nthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use\nunless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\n\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\nhe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.

Fridays all the time.)\n\n>It further at least implicitly advances the position that\n>sciences goes \"forward\" (and it is not clear what this means given the\n>context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\n>and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\n>weeded out via the \"critical function\" of science.\n\nI'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n>(Though why this critical\n>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\n>subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\n>of the application of any \"critical function\" concerning replication.\n>This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \"anything goes\" view.)\n\nI don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.

Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\n>resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply\n>do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\n\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.
