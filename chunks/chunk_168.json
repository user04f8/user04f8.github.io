There are some complete books, letters,\netc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of\nthe New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).

The\nIcon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles\nwho are weeping.  Christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what\nseems to be a small child.  This is, in fact, Mary's soul already with\nChrist in Heaven.  The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us\nas Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death.  It forshadows the\ngeneral resurrection on the last day.  The disciples were not surprised\nto find Mary's body missing from the grave.  She was the Mother of the\nSavior.  She was the first of all Christians.  She gave birth to the Word\nof God.  If it were not for her we would not be saved.

At the very top and very bottom of the screen\nthere is about a 3/4\" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes\neverything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can\nmanually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just\nshouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't \nbeen able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and\nboth times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried\nto bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of\ndays, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks\nbefore billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...\nSo, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what\nto do.

Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue\nfor pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:\n1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is\nsome number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)\n\n2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver\nwas drunk)\n\n3.

In\nexchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates.

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\n  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\n  (~Dec.1992).\n\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\n\n    ::\n    command: help\n    \n    user@host\n\n  where `user@host' is your email address.\n \n  \n_____\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?\n\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a\n  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\n  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.\n \n \n_____\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?\n\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\n\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\n  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\n  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\n  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\n  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\n  > their opinions.\n\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\n\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\n\n_____\n<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?\n\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\n  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\n  commands in the subject line:\n\n    subscribe\n    unsubscribe\n    help\n\n_____\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?\n\n  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\n  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade\n  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\n  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\n  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ\n  for alt.security.  \n  \n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\n\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\n  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\n  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\n  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\n  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\n  > but you may differ...\n\n_____\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?\n  \n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\n  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\n  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\n  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\n  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a\n  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.\n\n_____\n<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?\n\n\n  Remailing/Posting\n  -----------------\n  \n  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,\n    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.\n  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET\n    postings.\n  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information\n    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,\n    encrypted addresses, etc.)\n  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and\n    remailer site chaining.\n  \n  General\n  -------\n  \n  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy\n    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the\n    general public and their governments.\n  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies \n    by systems designers into\n    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'\n    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.\n  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than\n    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement\n    agencies.\n  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government\n    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to\n    strengthening and protecting it.\n\n\nISSUES\n======\n\n_____\n<6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?\n\n  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:\n\n  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic\n  > media which connect us.

A highly publicized endeavor of the organization\n  involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI\n  raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve\n  Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector\n  Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.\n  \n  In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee\n  with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated\n  November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented\n  Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national\n  public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly\n  by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in \n  ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):\n\n  > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to\n  > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create\n  > a consumer-oriented, public information network.

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\n  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\n  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\n  caller identification.\n\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For\n  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?\n\n  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies\n  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in\n  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.\n  \n  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):\n\n  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May\n  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card\n  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. \n  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying\n  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of\n  > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some\n  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department\n  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide\n  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of\n  > jurisdictions.\n\n  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated\n  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST\n  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science\n  Fiction Magazine:\n\n  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional\n  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the\n  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared\n  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,\n  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin\n  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only\n  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. \n  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that\n  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document\n  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.\n\n  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed\n  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier\n  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe\n  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:\n  \n  > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret\n  > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal\n  > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a\n  > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,\n  > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. \n  > \n  > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in\n  > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,\n  > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke\n  > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer\n  > seizure policies.

They are posted with his permission.  The\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\n\n-------\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\nSubject: Clipper Chip\n\n\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\nannouncing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\nif I have anything wrong):\n\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \nspecific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\n\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \nproducing\n\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \n\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\n\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \nof the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\n\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\nfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \nNo single person or authority should have the power to\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\n\nMartin Hellman\n\n----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: smb@research.att.com\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\n\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \nif you also post this message with it in which:\n\n1.

You\n   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left\n   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your \"left\n   and right window\" as you can have as many open as you wish instead \n   of just two.\n\n2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking\n   on the executable's icon.\n\n3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double\n   clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have\n   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The\n   \"browse\" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you\n   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.\n   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your\n   requirement for \"text reading and graphics viewing\".\n\nI know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up\nall the associations you need is the way to do it.\n\nIf Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be\npretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how\nsome things are done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIskandar Taib                          | The only thing worse than Peach ala\nInternet: NTAIB@SILVER.UCS.INDIANA.EDU |    Frog is Frog ala Peach\nBitnet:   NTAIB@IUBACS                 !\n"}, {"text": "From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nSubject: Re: ASTRONAUTS---What does weightlessness feel like?\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nX-Posted-From: algol.jsc.nasa.gov\nNNTP-Posting-Host: sol.ctr.columbia.edu\nLines: 81\n\n: In article <1993Apr29.121501@is.morgan.com>, jlieb@is.morgan.com (Jerry Liebelson) writes...\n: > I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like.

I'll\ntell you about my first flight.\n\nAt the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine\nstraightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab\nonto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)\nto prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my\ninvoluntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could\nfeel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while\nyou have a cold).\n\nAt that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,\nsince I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment\ngoing and keeping track of all the parts during the \"return\" of\ngravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay\nattention to physiology at that time.\n\nAfter about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one\nof the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion\nsickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly\n-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,\nconcious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to\nparabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I\nhad to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically\nuseless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in\nthe back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just\nthis purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.\n(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous\npeople who don't get sick on the thing.)\n\nI didn't think of it as a \"constant sensation of falling\" so\nmuch as like swimming in air.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\n\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\ndiscoveries.\n\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\n\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\nSun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\n\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\n\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\nachievements of the 20th century.\n     \n\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\n\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\n\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\n\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\nbackup and supplemental power.\n\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\ncontrol spacecraft.\n\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\nspacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body\nand the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\n\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\n\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\n\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\nbodies.\n\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\n\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\n\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\n\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\n\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet's dense cloud cover\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\nradioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their\ndescent toward the surface.\n\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\nneighborhood and our own planet.\n     \n\nThe Sun\n\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\nmaterial left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\n\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\nis 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\n\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\nyears to cool off completely.\n\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\n\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\nnever have developed on Earth.\n     \n\nMercury\n\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\nsolar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\n\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\nvisible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\n\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\nmiles).\n\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\ndensity of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\nand helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\nFahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\n\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\nSun! \n\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\nmake Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core\nor those of any of the planets.\n\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\nplanet's surface.\n     \n\nVenus\n\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\nrest.\n\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's\ninstruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\n\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\n\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\ntransmit data for another hour.\n\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\nexample, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\nplanets.\n\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as\ndense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\nEarth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\nspace. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\nlead.\n\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\nfirst means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\nNASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\nof the surface.\n\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\n\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\n\n     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\nalternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\n     \n\nEarth\n\n     As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\n\n     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\nthe early days of the solar system.\n\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\n\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\nplanet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\nejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\n\n     Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet's\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\n\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather\nsystems.\n\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\nEarth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\nplanet in dangerous ways.\n     \n\nThe Moon\n\n     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\n\n     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\n\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\n\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\n\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\n\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\ncaptured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\n     \n\nMars\n\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\nsystem's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\n\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\n\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\n\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\n\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\n\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\ndunes.\n\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\nthere.\n\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\n\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\n\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\nfog can form in valleys.\n\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\n\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\n\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\n\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\nEarth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \n     \n\nAsteroids\n\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\norbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\nWinslow, Arizona.\n\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\ndiameter of our Moon. \n\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\n\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes\nEarth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\n\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\nlike terrestrial rocks.\n\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\nseparated by very large distances.\n\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\nmaterials.\n     \n\nJupiter\n\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\nwas the first port of call.\n\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\nduring flybys in 1979.\n\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\ncharacterize Jupiter's atmosphere.\n\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\nplanet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\nbelow. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\n\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\nmillion years old.\n\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\n\n     Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\nminiature solar system.\n\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\nJupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\nto Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\n     \n\nGalilean Satellites\n\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\nplanet-sized satellites.\n\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.\n\n     Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\nGalilean moons.\n\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\ncold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its\ncenter.\n\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\nthe moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the\nsurface.\n\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\n\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\n     \n\nSaturn\n\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\nmiles) per hour.\n\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\nAugust 1981.\n\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\norbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\n\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\n\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\nthat make up the major rings.\n\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near\nSaturn's poles.\n\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps\nin the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \n\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\nVenus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\nUnfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's\ndense clouds.\n\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\nconverting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\n\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\nTitan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\n     \n\nUranus\n\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\nground observations since the planet's discovery over two\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\n\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\nsolar system.\n\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\n\n     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\nvapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\nplanet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\n\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\n\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\n\n     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\nits interior exposed on its surface.\n\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\n11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright\nparticles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,\nboulder-sized chunks.\n     \n\nNeptune\n\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's\natmosphere was more active than Uranus'. \n\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\nsize of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\nhour.\n\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\nother gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like\nUranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\n\n     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\nsimilar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\n\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\nwere not spotted.\n\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's\nglare for observers on Earth.\n\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\naccompany the planet's modest current rings.\n\n     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of\nwater-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\ncap. \n\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\nthick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\n     \n\nPluto\n\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\nNeptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\nremain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\n\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\ncelestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \n\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\n1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: the\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's\nand Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \n\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\n     \n\nComets\n\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\n\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\n\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\nrise to the comet's \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\nleft behind in a curved arc.\n\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\ndramatic light shows.\n\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\nto the inner solar system.\n\n     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\nbecause he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\nsee it.\n\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\nappearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\n\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\nhigh speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\nHalley's Comet in 1986.\n     \n\nConclusion\n\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\nneighbors in space. \n\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\nand beautiful places and objects.\n\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\n\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\ninvestigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\nprocesses on Earth.\n\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\nbelt.\n\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\nlunar base or a martian colony!\n\n- end -\n     \n"}, {"text": "From: mitchell@nodecg.ncc.telecomwa.oz.au (Clive Mitchell)\nSubject: Dataproducts LZR1260 not printing correctly\nOrganization: Regional Network Systems Group, Perth\nLines: 9\n\nJust an apology in advance for posting a binary to this newsgroup.\nI've had several attempts to mail it to the original poster but \nit's not getting through intact.\n\n-- \n    _--_|\\    Clive Mitchell               ph: +61 9 4916384\n   /      \\   Regional Network Systems     mitchell@telecomwa.oz.au\n>> *_.--._/   Perth , Western Australia\n         v\n"}, {"text": "From: ucer@ee.rochester.edu (Kamil B.

Congradulations tim. I think the other people answered\nyou on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internal\nconflicts policy). \n\tIsrael very often gets away with more\nthan most other nations (Due to U.S. vetos). While I am not\nfamiliar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi\nArabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the\npilgrims were iranian. Yes, the UN is biased but mostly in\nfavor of the US and its allies (Including Israel, Saudi Arabia\nand Pakistan) and against \"Outlaw\" countries like iran and more\nrecently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressive\ngovernments there but I think they get more slack than Israel\nfor things they do \"wrong\". Again the reason some condemnations\ndon't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. The\ngassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and\nsince Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation\nresulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involved\nanother case of who cares. It seems that until very recently no\none cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including\nin Israel and the occupied territories).\n\tAgain I appreciate the lack of personal insults.\n"}, {"text": "From: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great,\neven moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be due\nin part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, are\nparticularly slimline !\n\nI always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes\ntheir movements predictable.\n\nMy regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,\nI don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.\nAgain that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers\n(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,\nmaking any kind of maneuvering difficult.\n\nI've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and\nshifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about\na 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also\nsitting very still and getting a sore back.\n\nWe have a code system for turns, stop and for 'I need to shift position'.\n-- \nChris Seabrook, Fujitsu Open Systems Solutions Inc | Phone: +1-510-652-6200x118\n6121 Hollis Street, Emeryville, CA 94608-2092, USA | Fax:   +1-510-652-5532\n                                                   | DoD:    #0861\n             Per saltire gules and Or, a sun counterchanged.\n"}, {"text": "From: roland@sics.se (Roland Karlsson)\nSubject: Re: Magellan Venus Maps (Thanks)\nIn-Reply-To: baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov's message of 30 Mar 1993 00:34 UT\nLines: 14\nOrganization: Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Kista\n\n\nThanks Ron and Peter for some very nice maps.\n\nI have an advice though.

It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \nFamilies USA.\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \nthat doctors make too much money.\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \nOK.\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \nand are still simmering.\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \nof Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \ndo are stealing it from them.\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  \nKarl Marx lives.\n     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such \nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \nbecome a physician?\n     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should \nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \na doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a \ndoctor?\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \ncalled together to remake America's health care.\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \nto health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \nmajor cause of high medical costs.\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \na McDonald's?\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \ncabbages.\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \nthey might have been more honest if they had said:\n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \nproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, \nyou,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you \nguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; \ngetting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the \nmicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into \nthe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot \nvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease \nwhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.\n     \"You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single \nbiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is \namazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.\n     \"In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at \nyour blubbery bods all day.\n     \"So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and \nstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-\ngreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.\"\n     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, \nthere is another solution: Don't use them.\n     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those \nspine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands \nupon your head and declare you fit.\n     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest \npains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit \nthere, and pop in a couple of valves.\n     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that \noverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house \nthan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and \nmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?\n     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  \nAnd if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on \nhow to give it its shots.\n     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much \npollsters should earn?\n\n\nRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media \nServices.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n--\n**********************************************\nVinay J.
