What the supply must do,\nif presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the\nsupply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal\none amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we\nshould read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm \nresistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by\nnecessity, must be 1V.\n\nThe only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves\na circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output \npower transistor, and therefore reduce the output.\n\nSo, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAndy Collins, KC6YEY\nacollins@uclink.berkeley.edu\n\nps: If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project, I agree fully,\n    but I still have to do it, its graded ;^)\n\n"}, {"text": "From: rind@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu (David Rind)\nSubject: Re: centrifuge\nOrganization: Beth Israel Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston Mass., USA\nLines: 18\nDistribution: usa\nNNTP-Posting-Host: enterprise.bih.harvard.edu\n\nIn article <C5JsM5.Hrs@lznj.lincroftnj.ncr.com> rjf@lzsc.lincroftnj.ncr.com\n (51351[efw]-Robert Feddeler(MT4799)T343) writes:\n\n>: Could somebody explain to me what a centrifuge is and what it is\n>: used for?

These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\n: These days is just ain't true!  People can decide whether or not to have \n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's \n: another arguement...) so it's more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.  Again by\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\n\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\nhomosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\n\n: \n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\n: |> choice that should be protected by law.

Let's\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\n\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\n\n>> Obviously more philosophizing on this issue is possible, but I'm\n>> not sure that the readers of this newsgroup would want to delve\n>> into religious interpretation further.

The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\n   spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\n   shepherds from roaming.\n\n   A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\n   But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\n   Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\n   was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\n   in order that the land could be transferred to the army.\n\nAnd now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:\n\n   No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\n   today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\n   the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\n   by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\n   confined to seven \"development towns\", or *sowetos*, established\n   for them.\n\n   (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:\n   elias@ismennt.is)\n\nSo what you basically say is that \"we know for sure that nothing good happens\nthere now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived\nand that they were driven away by the Jews,  noone on earth knows about\nwhat the Jews did there.\"\n\nIs that what you said?

With three detectors properly arranged, one can often\nget positions down to ~arc minutes.\n\nBTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the\nfairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1\nms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a\ndistance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing\nand t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the\norder of 16 light years.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order.

You can\nimagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority\non a case-by-case basis.\n\nNot so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly\nwhat they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.\n\nJust as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a\ncase-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nThere is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with\nfree enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a\ngovernment that interferes with free enterprise in an \"efficient\"\nmanner; I call it political market failure.\n\nThus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to\nswallow the \"whole libertarian agenda.\"\n\nRoger Collins\n"}, {"text": "From: krsear02@ulkyvx.louisville.edu (Kendall 'Opusii' Sears)\nSubject: Re: Where did the hacker ethic go?\nLines: 46\nNntp-Posting-Host: ulkyvx.louisville.edu\nOrganization: University of Louisville\n\n>Where did the hacker ethic go?\n>\n>We hackers of the 70's and 80' are now comfortably employed\n>and supporting families.

It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the\nfact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less\ntraining time required. \n\n\tSmith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht\nthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which\nif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun\nfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and\nwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various \ngun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little\ntest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and\nshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times\nwere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.\n\n\tYou don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing\ncity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..\n\n\tOf course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\nchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that\n'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time\nto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.\n\n\tDon't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks\nin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,\nit was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the\noperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I\ndon't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.\n\n\tAs per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree\n100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \n\n-Just my $.02 + tax\n-------   Steve Syck        syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu        --------\n\n"}, {"text": "From: wagner@grace.math.uh.edu (David Wagner)\nSubject: Re: The doctrine of Original Sin\nOrganization: UH Dept of Math\nLines: 65\n\n\"Alan\" == E Alan Idler <aidler@sol.uvic.ca> writes:\n\nAlan> 2.

They have no righteousness of\ntheir own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own.  There\nis only the imputed righteousness of Christ, which believers receive\nthrough faith.\n\nAlan> 3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the\nAlan> concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies\nAlan> weren't free from sin?\n\nYour point is a little obscure here, but I think you are saying\nthat Christ used the \"innocence\" of newborn babes as a metaphor\nfor spiritual re-birth.  But this is not what he did.\nIf you look at the text, he did not speak\nof spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  We are\nborn of the Spirit once, not twice or several times.\nWe are also born of the flesh once.  The Lord makes it\nclear that these are separate and different events.\nIt is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual\nbirth as re-birth because it is a second birth\n(for example, Titus 3:5).  But it is not a second\n*spiritual* birth.\n\nThe only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth,\nwhich is used as a symbol of `new life' -- not of innocence.  When an\ninfant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither\ninnocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is\nbaptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a\nnew life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians\n2:5).  Then the believer has God's assurance of the forgiveness of\ntheir sins, and of Christ's imputed righteousness.\n\nFor references, see \n\tThe Augsburg Confession Article II, Original Sin, \n\tThe Apology to the Augsburg Confession, \n\t\tArticle II, Original Sin, \n\tthe Formula of Concord, Article I, Original Sin, and \n\tLuther's Large Catechism, Part 4, Baptism.  \n\nFor something more recent, see \"Baptized into God's Family: The\nDoctrine of Infant Baptism\" by Andrew Das, available from Northwestern\nPublishing House.

(And there are plenty of other examples.)\n>Can you reconcile this?\n\nThe problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about\nthe Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known\nall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to\nthe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the \nconservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is\na (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone\nwho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.\nWhile I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official\nposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).\n\nThe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in\nterms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact \nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \n(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would \nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.\n\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer's Handbook\", \"The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\nwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\nanswered God's words he would have said something like \"I'm here in this\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\nand explanations that others use.\n\nI hope this helps.\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\n| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\n| University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\n| Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}, {"text": "From: garrett@Ingres.COM \nSubject: Re: Watergate (was: Temper tantrums from the 1960's\nSummary: Still doesn't get it\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.4-b1  \nKeywords: \nOrganization: ASK Computer Systems, Ingres Product Division\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 87\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.215127.29919@oracle.us.oracle.com>, mfriedma@us.oracle.com (Michae writes...\n>In article <1993Apr19.213012.23123@pony.Ingres.COM> garrett@Ingres.COM  writes:\n>>In article <1993Apr17.043704.23702@oracle.us.oracle.com>, mfriedma@us.oracle.com (Michae writes...\n>>>In article <1993Apr17.023211.23547@pony.Ingres.COM> garrett@Ingres.COM  writes:\n>>>>In article <philC5Lru6.LxA@netcom.com>, phil@netcom.com (Phil Ronzone) writes...\n>>>>>In article <1993Apr15.195139.29457@pony.Ingres.COM> garrett@Ingres.COM  writes:\n>>>>Why\n>>>>did Ford go to the trouble of pardoning him if he did nothing wrong? \n> \n>>>Duh....

Nineteen full\nand half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days\nprovide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor\nexhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what\nfolks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.\n\nSpeakers at Xhibition 93 include: \n\n  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, \n  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, \n  Doug Young, and many others.\n\nXhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional\nconferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of\ninterest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object\nManagement Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server\ntechnologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;\nand (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.\n\nWith the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing\napplications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a\nplayer as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many\ndesktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be\nevaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and\nsuppliers.\n\nThe mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information\nto the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference\nat Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide\nthe *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX\ndevelopers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has\nwhat you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is\nthe place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you\nwhat you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development\nKits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an\nXhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience\nis growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a\nconfusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of\nthe other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.\n\n\n-Aub Harden\n Technical Program Manager\n harden@ics.com\n\n\n        X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade\n         ******    *****    Show for Corporate\n        *      *       *    Software Development\n         ******     ***  \n             *         *    201 Broadway\n          ***     *****     Cambridge, MA  02139\n\n              Windows on Distributed Computing\n\n                 June 7 - 11,   San Jose, CA\n\n           xhibit@ics.com  uunet!ics.com!xhibit\n        Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555\n\n      Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions, Inc.\n"}, {"text": "From: PETCH@gvg47.gvg.tek.com (Chuck)\nSubject: Daily Verse\nLines: 6\n\n\n   This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"You who now hear these words spoken by\nthe prophets who were there when the foundation was laid for the house of the\nLORD Almighty, let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.\n\nZechariah 8:9\n"}, {"text": "From: cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (Carl Ellison)\nSubject: Re: Licensing of public key implementations\nOrganization: Stratus Computer, Software Engineering\nLines: 28\nNNTP-Posting-Host: ellisun.sw.stratus.com\n\nIn article <1993Apr4.221640.8104@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> jebright@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (James R Ebright) writes:\n>I guess we will have to wait for the time in the far future\n>when everyone uses such good crypto that the NSA has no job.

Each time a member of the one family\nkills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified\nin killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this\nsequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't\nlike dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family\ngoes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there\nis a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty.\nHow do you resolve this?\n\nWell, they are all murders.\n\nNow, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \"problem,\" but\nit still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.\n\nAnd, in any case, the nested \"murderer\" in the definition of murder\ncannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity.\nAnd, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the\nfirst person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily\na murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently\nunreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the\ninformation is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\n\nkeith\n"}, {"text": "From: Kathy_McTaggart@mindlink.bc.ca (Kathy McTaggart)\nSubject: Sound input in SE/30\nOrganization: MIND LINK! - British Columbia, Canada\nLines: 19\n\nA couple of questions for the multimedia set:\n\n\n1.

As I recall, one can hook up the\npower cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my \nQuadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which\nallows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the\nsocket separately.
