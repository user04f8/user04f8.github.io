[1]\n\nBorn 1964\nSecretary-Typist\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\n\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\nMicrodistrict No. 3\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\n\n\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation \nwhatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There \nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \nto Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded \na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we've \nscared them enough, let's leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \nand it was dark . . .\n\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially \nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to \nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \nwasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \nlive literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \ndriver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \nhe said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \nOK . . .\n\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they're not going \nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to \ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \nnothing had happened.\n\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and \ndidn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't\nguess.\n\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\nhome and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \nZimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did\nour apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don't they want Armenians? Well what \nare they after, if they're already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \nthat, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \ncabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.\n\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\non in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn't know what she\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I \ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see \nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can \nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \nWe cleared the table.\n\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't \nsee what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \n. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking\nsomewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's \nan Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\nthat means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not \nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \nfeet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak\n. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he\ngot up and left or not.\n\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \nkept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop \nthem.\n\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \nand it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't \ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \ndin and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \nshouting Father's name, \"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\" or\nsomething like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won't come in there, \nthey'll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We'll tell them \nthat we live alone here.\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in \nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \nthat I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I \ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told \nher anything or not.\n\nThen . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the \napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \ncommanding them: \"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\n\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \nin front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how \nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The \natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \nthemselves who would go first.\n\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \nHe looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It \nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we're done here.\" They are beating\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the \nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \nwindows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong \nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that\nI'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \ndon't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I \nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\n\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't \nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\nelse is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death \ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.\n \nI come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \nclothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can't make \nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though \nhe's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\nthere, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \nbrought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\" How do I know who's who \nand what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going \nto tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's \nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding \non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \nthere. So they survived.\n\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I'm not going to let you \nin the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings \nand we'll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I'll stay at your place because of\nwhat's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came \nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\n\nI came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone \nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \ncame to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \nsimply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \nit was hard to breathe . . .\n\nMy supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our \nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \nwithout stopping. After us.\n\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\nfrom Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young \nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. \nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\nquickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\" At that moment \nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \nhere, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \nthe soldiers said, \"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the \nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \nDaghestan police were there.\n\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they \nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't \nknow what to do with the rest.\"\n\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \nboss said, \"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \nambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People \ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\n\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't \nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \nthink of something that yours haven't already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything \nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, \nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at \nthem.\n\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \nyour brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can \nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\nward.\n\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can't believe you put on such a\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \ncouldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\nthat I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one \nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \nArmenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must \nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\nthe street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \nand off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \nafter that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't \ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \nI didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \ncould. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \nwho didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, \nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\nmyself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \nfrom all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \nThere was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's \nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. \nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\nbreathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\nwasn't cut.\n\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It's Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \n\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same \nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you \nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \nclub that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it \nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \nright and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \ntheater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \nthe attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \ncouldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my \neyes.\n\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren't you an \nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\" They\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\nthey should have, with their IDs.\n\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't \nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the \nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \nalready in the city.\n\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \nfamilies. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't \nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult \nnow to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify \nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\ngasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\nMicrodistrict 3.\n\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \nthe corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\nG., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \nshe still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \ncarried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.\n\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \ncouldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\nshe couldn't remember anyone's face.\n\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\nout of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\nthe Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the \nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \nmeetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\n\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our\ncase, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\nthe ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \npeople, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were\nall from Kafan.\n\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't \nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina \nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out \nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \nwe're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\nhe's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not \nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn't at home, my family and \nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is \nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \nthat Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \nhead I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the \nsame time\n\nI'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one\nwasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\nexactly I can't say.                                                     \n\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, \nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \ndormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\n\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come \nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \nthey've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been\nbeating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he \nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\n\nI've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. \nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \ncurfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, \nI can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, \nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and \nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have \nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they \nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our \napartment.\n\nI don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been \nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You'll come in this entryway over my dead\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't \neven know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well\nwhat they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They \ncouldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \nstopped them.\n\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \nMaybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is \nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\ndidn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\" \nOnly they didn't shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\n\nThat's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find\nLyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\nbut they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\ncourage to . . .\n\nA boy said to my mother \"Where's the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to \nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \n\"What's happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \nfind out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or \nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out \nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\nher mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \nway to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it\nhappened in.\n\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting \nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \nless calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I \ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\nlet's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how \nlong we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\" I don't get it, all\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \nfor? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\nsays, \"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the \nnight at someone else's.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \nshouts, \"Come back, they're coming!\" They didn't have enough time to get a \nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his \nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \nthey're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\n\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\nAsya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \nsomething like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who \nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but \nthey didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up \nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren't you taking anything from this \napartment?\" He says, \"I don't need anything.\" And the women who were standing \nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \nmad, and he says, \"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\ndirection.\n\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \njust didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \nshe didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where's the girl who was here?\"\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn't\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There's so much water down there, she \nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \nthe basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn't know that, and \nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't \njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\n\nAfter that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \ndidn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \nwho sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think \nthat they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but \nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\" That's \nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \nstanding on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\nyou want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\nThat trick didn't work on them.\n\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \nthat it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, \nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \nAnd no one did anything.

Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems \nto imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth \n(constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be \nnecessary.\n\nIt may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different \nfrom person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is \nright and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple \nminds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly \nthis intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different \nfrom yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute,\nthen at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong.\nI just don't believe that God is that rigid.\n\n> >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \n> >to be absolute truth.

Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that \ntheir fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.\n\nI think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter \nof human interpretation and therefore error-prone.

While the exact details are not known, it is believed\nto concern the Oiler's future.\n\nRumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\nwith Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\nPocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\nthe deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\nrenegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\n\nNorthlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\nbut the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.\n\nAs for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly\nsupportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\nteam, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\nthat the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\nthan many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if\nthe team does move, there is no place more deserving than\nHamilton.

You gave the\nimpression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are\ncorrect re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it,\nyou can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your\ndisk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.

First let me say that when I say \"intelligent\"\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \nit's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\nfor a putative technological alien.\n\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\nit's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\nwouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\nlarge creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\n\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly\nlost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\nthat must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\nThe dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production \nbecause it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \nI'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\nthe size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\nwould be capable of that much activity.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n"}, {"text": "From: MCAVALCANTI%VORTEX.UFRGS.BR@UICVM.UIC.EDU\nSubject: DTP\nOrganization: UTexas Mail-to-News Gateway\nLines: 3\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu\n\nPlease Ineed information about desk top publishe- post graduate courses\nand if possible email address or normal mail.\nthanks in advance\n"}, {"text": "From: psyrobtw@ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.edu (Robert Weiss)\nSubject: 16 Apr 93   God's Promise in Psalm 32:8\nOrganization: University at Buffalo\nLines: 6\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41\nNntp-Posting-Host: ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.edu\n\n\n\tI will instruct thee and teach thee\n\tin the way which thou shalt go:\n\tI will guide thee with mine eye.\n\n\tPsalm 32:8\n"}, {"text": "From: plastic@ecr.mu.oz.au (Jason_Brinsley LEE)\nSubject: 25 words or less....\nOrganization: Computer Science, University of Melbourne, Australia\nLines: 13\n\nEverywhere we see and hear about christianity (due to its\nevangalistic nature).

The few things\nthat can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is\n*not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.\n-- \nSVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\nbetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"}, {"text": "Organization: Ryerson Polytechnical Institute\nDistribution: na\nFrom: jeff <ACPS7117@RyeVm.Ryerson.Ca>\nSubject: For Sale: Sound Blaster Card...Hurry!\nLines: 9\n\nWell it seems that I have a soundblaster card for sale since\nI recently purchased a SBPro.

The problem was not the resurrection\nwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population \n(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was\nthat Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the\nstate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism \nbecomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,\nand were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,\nand hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since\nChristians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is\nseen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the\nissues with the resurrection.\n\nrandy\n\n[I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically\nbecause they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did\ncause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus.\nOf course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other\nthan a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians\nscholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event --\nin effect, a delusion.  --clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: steve-b@access.digex.com (Steve Brinich)\nSubject: Re: Fighting the Clipper Initiative\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications, Greenbelt, MD USA\nLines: 24\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\n> > >As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist (:-), I'at a loss for\n> > >specific objections that don't sound frighteningly technical.\n> >\n> >  The idea that foisting the Cripple Chip standard on US manufacturers would\n> >result in saying \"Sayonara\" to yet another high-tech market isn't technical,\n> >isn't in the least difficult to understand, and plays on a concern lots of\n> >people are worried about already....     \n>\n>  Could you expand on this...?\n\n\n  Simple -- if you have a choice between:\n\n 1.

But \nmost people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern\nhis elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish\npeople in 1914.\n\n\n     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'\n      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), \n          \"The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi\", p. 213.)\n\n\nI refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does\nnot serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of\nwhat happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians,\ndecided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping \nout a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive \nethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of\nx-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our\npeople. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and \nnot lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We \ncannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to \nkeep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as\nto help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because \nof their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims \nof the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, \nto determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'
