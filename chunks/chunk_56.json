A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater\ncan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are\npotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall\ncorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses\ninvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which\nis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with\nsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic\nglutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts\nattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic\nnecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the\ndelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver\ndamage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.\n\nAs to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams\nof acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably\ncause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.\n\nBob Schmieg\n"}, {"text": "From: Nanci Ann Miller <nm0w+@andrew.cmu.edu>\nSubject: Re: Concerning God's Morality (long)\nOrganization: Sponsored account, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\nLines: 56\n\t<1993Apr5.084042.822@batman.bmd.trw.com>\nNNTP-Posting-Host: po5.andrew.cmu.edu\nIn-Reply-To: <1993Apr5.084042.822@batman.bmd.trw.com>\n\n\njbrown@batman.bmd.trw.com writes:\n> > Sorry, but there are no supernatural\n> > forces necessary to create a pathogen.

I believe that also this experience is\ncounterfeited by Satan - so that for example yoga and other\neastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to\nleave the body and float off. Someone tried to sell me a book in\nLos Angeles airport entitled \"Easy Journeys to Other Planets\"\nwhich uses such techniques.\n\nThe occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body\ndeparture - the book \"The Challanging Counterfeit\", about a\nformer medium who gets saved, tells how the author, on his last\ntrance, was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him\nwhile returning to his body at the end of the seance\nbecause of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally\nprotected by the Lord.\n\nThere may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and the\nphenomena of 'tripping'.\n\nAs regards the connection between body and soul, there is an\ninteresting verse in Ecclesiastes. In a passage talking about\nold age, the preacher writes \"Then man goes to his eternal home\nand mourners go about the streets. Remember Him--before the\nsilver cord is severed.\" (12.5-6) My understanding of this\nsilver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul\nin a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an\nastronaut's air-line to his spaceship.\nWhen a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches\nthe soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken:\nastral projection can be dangerous! Bulle, I think, reports a\ncase of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in his\napartment, with no apparent external cause.\n\nBarney Resson\n\"Many shall run to and fro, & knowledge shall increase\" (Daniel)\n"}, {"text": "From: asimov@wk223.nas.nasa.gov (Daniel A.

Science is not a religion,\nbecause there is no faith nor dogma.\n>\n>>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind,\n>>whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present\n>>in any religion.\n>\n>Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of\n>being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in\n>God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists\n>would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a\n>God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?\n\nHave you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher\nis not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.\n\nA Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is\na special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,\nto conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence\nof That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma\ncomes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example\nof faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.\nSure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the\nneeds of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,\nand that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the\ninterpretations are flawed.\n\nScience, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a\nBUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.\nA scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to\nsuit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,\n*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs\nare deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving\nthe beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect\nthe best information currently available.  That's the only rational\nthing to do.  That's good philosophy.\n\nCan you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,\nand new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many\nscientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding\nof everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion\nviews its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of\nthose beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which\nconflicts with them.\n>\n>Please explain how \"just because\" thinking kills people.  (And please\n>state more in your answer than \"Waco.\")\n\nIt's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require\na good rational justification of the killing.  I don't consider\n``he's Jewish'', or ``he was born of Jewish parents'', or\n``this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational justification.\n\n>By the way, I wasn't aware mass suicide\n>was a problem.

I am thinking  \nof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  \nthat more RAM would be helpful.

Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board?

IMHO the wider meaning is not\n:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to\n:  be!  [....]\n\n:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody\n:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very\n:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know\n:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]\n\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\n\nI, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\n\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX\n     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password\n     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.\n\n     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\n\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\n     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\n\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\n\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\n     project.\n\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\n     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\n\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\n     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.\n\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\n\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\nworkplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\n\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\n\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is\nto communicate.

She said\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\nchange...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place )\nand more....\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\ncounsel.\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\n  This life is \"but dust\". As long as the comfort of this life\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\nwith whom we come in contact.\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\nsupport the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\nfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that\nwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me\nliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent\npeople. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)\nIt is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer\nlife to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.\nThink about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that\na friend is in error, but you don't want to \"cause trouble\".\nRighteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are\nwe are Christ's lips and hands on earth. Don't be afraid to\nsimply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a\nfervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance.\nIn more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's\nkeeper.\n\nIn Jesus and Mary,\nElizabeth\n"}, {"text": "From: mclase@riemann.math.mun.ca (Michael Clase)\nSubject: Print to file: how do I print the file later?\nOrganization: Mathematics Department, Memorial University of Newfoundland\nLines: 30\n\nHere's the situation:\n\nAt home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.

The 27th was a short day at\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and \nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to \n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\n\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, \nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\naround it. I ask, \"What's going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\ndidn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There's\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\n\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \nthings, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.\n\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. \nI didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\no'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \ndemonstration and move slowly.\n\nMy wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \nand went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 \nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\n\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\nuneasy and said, \"No, let's stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\n\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \naggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \nfollowed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was \nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don't need \nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it \nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\n\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' \napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't \nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try \nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\n\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\n\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\nlor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \nhas a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of \npeople smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\n\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \nI turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, \nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \nstreet. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \nleft. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\n\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It's OK, it'll pass, \nthey're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn't \nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't \nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't \nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking \nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and \nhashish to put in a store window!\n\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \nwould stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, \nthe police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't \nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \nTrue, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-\nvaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people \ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \ncouldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \nSumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.\n\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let's go upstairs.\" \nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\n\nWe spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\n\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\nyou couldn't even see him.\n\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

Advice from a grad student.\n\n\tI agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.\nThe important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and \nlearn as much as possible about it.  \n\n\tIn my five years of education in this field, though brief \ncompare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of \nquestion a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into\nElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or\nCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this\nkind of question is irrelevant.  \n \n\tI have come to believe that choosing CS because one \ndoes not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does\nnot like to program is really doing an injustice of building\nand computer and making it useful for something.  Everything\nis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a \npart of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.\n\n\tMy advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision\nbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to \nlearn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your \npersective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to\nexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the\nschool would make a student choose a major before her/his\nsophamore year.                  \n\n\tHey you may be so interested in this field that you \ndecided to learn all about the making of computers in which \ncase, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.\n\n\tAbout the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you\nare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. \nIf you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  \nLike wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.        \n\n- Chung Yang\n\n"}, {"text": "From: tedward@cs.cornell.edu (Edward [Ted] Fischer)\nSubject: Re: Ind.

Up comes Moses,\nonce the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes\nDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King \nNebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes\nNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent\ntakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\nto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\ncomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.\nUp comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS\nagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years\nwith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself\n\"I am.\" \n\nWhile you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that\nKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\npeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\nall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells\nof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is\ndifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly\nreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\nBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different\nperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\ndares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's\ntestimony, even though different from those prior, consistently\ndescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  \n\nNow.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic\non the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \"I am\".  He has\nrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).\nPlease believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.\n\nAre you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \nAre you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\nshepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\nprogrammers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\ncomplete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\nthat is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\ndisplay of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\nKing Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?\n"}, {"text": "Subject: Re: Hockey guest spots...\nFrom: Paul H.

PEXlib is a slightly\n\"lower\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\nextension to X.\n\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\n- Is free of \"policy\"\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\n\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\n\nIf you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages\non Clipper.\n\nThe name of the encryption algorithm is \"Skipjack.\"\n\nMartin Hellman had written\n\n                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part\n                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK\n                producing\n\n                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nTo which I responded:\n\n        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\n        \"family key\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\n        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?\n\nI was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack\nbeing a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key\nfor the family key SK.\n\n        The unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\n        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\n        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\n        Compute the 64-bit block\n\n                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]\n\n        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\n        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\n        (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\n        they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\n        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\n        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\n\nThe seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on\na laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people\nso that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during\nan entire \"programming session\" to generate keys for a stream of serial\nnumbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be\nthrown out if desired).\n\nThe serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed\nby padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding\nfor each value).\n\nThe resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired\nup with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The\nfloppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two\nescrow agencies.\n\nDorothy Denning\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nI am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.\nPlease remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree\nwith it's contents and implications.

This 1:1M database has been produced from\n  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with\n  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]\n\n  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)\n  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries\n  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360\n  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for\n  every half degree longitude and latitude.\n \n  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine\n  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).\n  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and\n  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as\n  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask\n  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.\n  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.\n  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to\n  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.\n\nNCAR data\n---------\n  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of\n  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at\n  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.\n  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending\n  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,\n  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive\n  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,\n  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.\n\nUNC data tapes with voxel data\n--------------\n  There are 2 \"public domain\" tapes with data for the comparison and\n  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT\n  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.\n  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)\n\n  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from\n  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD\n\nNASA\n----\n  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data\n  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,\n  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following\n  address for more info:\n\n     National Space Science Date Center\n     Goddard Space Flight Center\n     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771\n     Telephone: (301) 286-6695\n     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\n  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.\n  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log\n  in as 'NODIS' (no password).\n\n  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,\n  no parity, one stop). At the \"Enter Number:\" prompt, enter MD and\n  carriage return. When the system responds \"Call Complete,\" enter a few\n  more carriage returns to get the \"Username:\" and log in as 'NODIS' (no\n  password).\n\n  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of\n  what's there is available at present.\n\nEarth Sciences Data\n-------------------\n\n  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including\n  imagery. This listing is called \"Earth Sciences Resources on Internet\",\n  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]\n  in the directory COGS under the name \"internet.resources.earth.sci\"\n\n  Some sites include:\n  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images\n  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from\n        Magellan and Viking missions etc.\n        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole\n        archive (the index is about 200K by itself).

Background imagery/textures/datafiles\n=========================================\n\n First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP\nlist above.\n\n24-bit scanning:\n----------------\n  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for\n  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :\n  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll\n  house supplies.\n  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have\n  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.\n\nBooks with textures:\n--------------------\n  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.\n  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also\n  a wide variety of stock art is available.\n  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,\n  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.\n\n  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books\n  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your\n  graphics work.

Introduction to rendering algorithms\n========================================\n\na. Ray-Tracing:\n---------------\n\n  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read\n  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would\n  suggest:\n   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press\n     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4\n  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong\n  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines\n  (erich@eye.com)\n\nThere's a more concise reference also:\n\n  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\", in\n  \"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,\n  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.\n\nIt contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.\n\nb. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)\n--------------------------\n\nA good reference is:\n\n        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,\n        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.\n\nc.

Where can I find the geometric data for the:\n================================================\n\na. Teapot ?\n-----------\n\n\"Displays on Display\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole\nstory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has\nthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe\nmodel of the teapot.\n\nIEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \"Jim Blinn's Corner\" describes\nan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for\nexample are used.\n\nThe OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get\nthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\n\nb. Space Shuttle ?\n------------------\n\nTolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle\ndatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):\n\nmodel1:\nA modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)\n\n406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)\n389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).\nPayload doors non-existent.\nUnits: unknown.\n\nSimon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He\nsaid there is no proprietary information associated with it.\n\nmodel2:\nThe newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in\n\ngondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo\nhanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data\n\nmodel3:\nThe triangles' model.\n\nThis model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.\n\nGreg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did\nnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.\n\nmodel4:\nThe NASA model.\n\nThe file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,\ndefining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:\n\n<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>\n\nFrom then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions\n\n3473 vertices.\n2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,\n 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,\n 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).\nPayload doors closed.\nUnits: inches.\n\nJon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model\nProprietary info: unknown\n\nmodel5:\nThe old shuttle model.\n\nThe file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.\n\n104 vertices.\n452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).\nPayload doors open.\nUnits: meters.\n\nWe have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for\nsome years now.

Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it\"\n\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\n\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the\n  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,\n  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass\n  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\n\nMicrostation Imager\n-------------------\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\n  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\n\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\n\n  Contact:\n  Rodney Hoinkes\n  Head of Design Applications\n  Centre for Landscape Research\n  University of Toronto\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Resource Listing\n-- \nNick (Nikolaos) Fotis         National Technical Univ. of Athens, Greece\nHOME: 16 Esperidon St.,       InterNet : nfotis@theseas.ntua.gr\n      Halandri, GR - 152 32   UUCP:    mcsun!ariadne!theseas!nfotis\n      Athens, GREECE          FAX: (+30 1) 77 84 578\n"}, {"text": "From: mzhao@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Min Zhao)\nSubject: cheap hard drives for your PC/XT\nNntp-Posting-Host: top.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\nOrganization: The Ohio State University\nLines: 16\n\n \n   I have a few the original IBM 10Mb harddisks for sale.

I have a IIsi that came\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\n\nPeter Hansen\nBell Northern Research\npgmoffc@BNR.ca\n"}, {"text": "From: ss@apmaths.uwo.ca (SULTAN SIAL)\nSubject: Re: Merlin, Mithras and Magick\nOrganization: Applied Mathematics, U.W.O\nNntp-Posting-Host: lab1.apmaths.uwo.ca\nLines: 9\n\nIn article <93111.195217A54SI@CUNYVM.BITNET> <A54SI@CUNYVM.BITNET> writes:\n\n[stuff about Mithras deleted]\n\n>Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec.
