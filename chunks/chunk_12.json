Related\n newsgroups, appropriate topics, how to introduce an encryption scheme.\nX-Last-Updated: 1993/04/16\n\nArchive-name: cryptography-faq/part02\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\n\n\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette\n\nThis is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n\n  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always\n  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.\n  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same\n  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the\n  readers want to see.\n\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n\n  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were\n  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be\n  patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many\n  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,\n  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of\n  people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your\n  postings in the right group.\n\n  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic\n  ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.\n\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some\n  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a\n  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.\n\n  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some\n  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by\n  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the\n  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is\n  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some\n  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts\n  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but\n  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most\n  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.\n\n  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,\n  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and\n  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the\n  introductory textbooks.\n\n  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at\n  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens\n  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily\n  answered on your own.\n\n  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some\n  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your\n  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to\n  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated\n  in some areas.)\n\n  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.\n  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted\n  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break\n  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough\n  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will\n  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to\n  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more\n  layer of complication and come back for another round.\n\n  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA\n  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope\n  of this FAQ.\n\n  Among professionals, a common rule of thumb is that if you want to\n  design a cryptosystem, you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst.\n"}, {"text": "From: moroney@world.std.com (Michael Moroney)\nSubject: Re: Vulcan?

Hundreds are missing.\n\nScattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley \nand across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's \nmassacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.\n\nFrom that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of \nAskeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters \nof Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their \nown lines.\n\nWe landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last \ntroops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out. \nThey left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov, \nwho oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert \nto ease their departure.\n\nA local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their \ndead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the \nsame, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian \npositions.\n\nIn all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another \n31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures \ndo not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed \nthe Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also \ndo not include other as yet undiscovered bodies\n\nZahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200 \npeople shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came \nby different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and \nof leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies \nwe saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. \nThe bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which\nkilled others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. \nAll are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly \nclothing of workers.\n\nOf the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national \nvolunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians, \nincluding eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS, \nAPPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED \nIN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.\n\nSEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD \nINJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT.

Azeri views on this dispute have\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\n\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\n\nThe following should be interesting. \n\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\n1991, page 28, we read:\n\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\n\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\n\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\n\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\n[AR] history of the conflict.\n\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\n \n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\n\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\n \n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\n \nIt's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the \nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\nplay dead. \n\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\n[AR] possessions?\n\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\n \n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\n\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\n \n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\n\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\nhave us believe.\n \n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\n\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\nclaim. \n\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \n\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\n\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\n\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\n\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\nwas stated as 11,000.\n\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\n\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \nMuslims in Karabakh!\n\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\nassuming no Kurds!\n\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\n\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and\n  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis\n  Republic.\n\n  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!\n\n\t\t\t\tChairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN. Narimanov\n\n\t\t\t\tPeople's Commissar for Foreign Affairs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGuseinov\"\n\n[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their\n[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian\n[AR] rule. \n\nNo, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule\nin the Caucasus, including Karabakh!\n\n[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew\n[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How\n[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in\n[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and\n[AR] demanded separation from California?\n\nNon-sequitur. \n \n[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement\n[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.\n\nArmenian historians don't say this!\n\n[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the\n[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and\n[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.\n\nConsidering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and\ntheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an \nargument totally invalid!\n\n[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to\n[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,\n[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.\n\nWishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-\npolitical advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\n\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This\n[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the\n[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory\n[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.\n\nSuch agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of\nArmenians.\n \n[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the\n[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the\n[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the\n[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.\n\nFine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian\nenclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory\nis the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local\npopulation! \n \n[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should\n[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as\n[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the\n[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can\n[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri\n[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.\n \nAzerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their\nown future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are \nactions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war\nin isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as\nan act of Allied aggression! \n \n[AR] Dr. Alec Rasizade, senior research officer at the Academy of Sciences\n[AR] of Azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the Harriman Institute of\n[AR] Columbia University in New York.\n\nHa!\n\n \n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\nS.D.P.A.

Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that\nthe >=15\" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over\ndistances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore\n*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*\n(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN\nInformation Systems in Toronto) before sale.

It is to those\nwho read with open mind, that I address myself.\n\n%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\n%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the\n%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member\n%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial\n%discrimination as \"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or\n%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic\n%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing\n%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of\n%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,\n%social, cultural or any other field of public life.\"\n\nWhile the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,\nas the text currently stands I know of no country in which\nracial discrimination of some sort can not be found.\nIt makes no mention of the need for for a legislative\nviolation.\n\n%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining\n%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The\n%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since\n%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli\n%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of\n%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United\n%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial\n%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.\n\nIf you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative\nstatements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be\napplied to any other case where the council perceives some form\nof racial discrimination as previously exhibited.\n\nScarey thought.\n\n%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of\n%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native\n%non-Jews born in that country. \n\nActually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not\nalienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be\ncorrect, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes\napparent.  This slant permeates the text.\n\n%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas\n%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most\n%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the\n%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.\n\nThe above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting\nBeduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.\nYour own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the\nissue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].\n\n%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim\n%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant\n%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).\n\nIf I recall correctly, at the time \"zionism\" took off, there\nwas no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any\nfactual contradictory evidence .\n\n%But the\n%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and\n%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the\n%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native\n%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and\n%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could\n%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000\n%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.\n\nDo you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on \"most\nof their villages\"?\n\n%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to\n%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their\n%political repression and their destitution.\n\nThere is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later\nused for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the\nintention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was\nthat this was not the case.\n\nYou also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded\nthis.  As you do again, below.\n\n%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied\n%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus\n%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its\n%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered\n%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security\n%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and\n%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these\n%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.\n\nNot quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,\nthough it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.\nIsrael never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other\nannexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.\n\n%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,\n%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of\n%international law and UN resolutions.\n\nOut of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,\nwhat int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories\ncaptured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country\npreviously (other than Iraq) ?\n\n%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under\n%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as\n%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a\n%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).\n\nIncorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against\non an \"ethnic or racial\" basis.  Therefore your above statement is\nincorrect.\n\nI also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,\nthe only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.\nHowever, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist\nat the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not\nargue racial discrimination during that period!\n\n%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a\n%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that\n%represents them in world affairs.\n\nOnce again, some do, some don't.\n\n%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab\n%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant\n%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.\n\nAnother generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care\nabout anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you\nespouse.\n\n%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the\n%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject\n%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be\n%challenged in court.\n\nIncorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.\nFurthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all\nof the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some\nare, but this is not due to the \"whims\" of the military as\nmuch as the sizeof the task/organization.\n\n%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied\n%territories are permitted to carry firearms.\n\nIncorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in\nDaheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of\nthe intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.\n\n%Jewish settlers have\n%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents\n%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel\n%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in\n%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will\n%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates\n%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish\n%settlement.\n\nThat is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your\npurpose is/was in posting this.\n\n%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them\n%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For\n%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected\n%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by\n%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish\n%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and\n%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to\n%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in\n%practice.\n\nOnce again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,\nright?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way\nyou seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but\nas a result of what actions?\n\n%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the\n%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are\n%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on\n%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these\n%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied\n%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in\n%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews\n%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government\n%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of\n%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;\n%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their\n%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and\n%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian\n%children are denied the right to learn their history and\n%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end\n%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the\n%authorities.\n\n1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.\n    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no\n    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish\n    collective.\n\n2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind\n    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has\n    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large\n    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case \n    in point.\n\n3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation\n    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously\n    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.\n    It is based upon Jordan's school system.\n\n4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another\n    gross generalization.  \n\n%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of\n%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never\n%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the\n%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its\n%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards\n%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is\n%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs\n%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately\n%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen\n%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of \n%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme\n%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in\n%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the\n%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.\n\nAnother generalization, but lets not stop here.\nThe transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,\nMoledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the\nterritories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,\nI recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered\npreviously.\n\n%Although sexual\n%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,\n%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal\n%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system\n%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.\n\nWhen was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,\nnor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious\nintervention is best answered by the proportional representation and\nthe lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.\n\n%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on\n%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has\n%not produced any written Constitution. \n\nSimply incorrect.\nThe answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the\ndynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your\ncontentions to the sidelines.\n\n%Zionism predicates a state\n%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,\n%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak\n%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli\n%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be\n%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial\n%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only\n%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the\n%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nBut the discrimination is not based upon race.\nOops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.\n\n%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that\n%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -\n%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed\n%to fail.\n\nReal world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.\nOf course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as\nyou are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate\nshall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the\namount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00.\n\n\n\n-- \nShai Guday              | Stealth bombers,\nOS Software Engineer    |\nThinking Machines Corp. |\tthe winged ninja of the skies.\nCambridge, MA           |\n"}, {"text": "From: marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu (Zauberer)\nSubject: Re: locking lugnuts / tire rebalance??\nOrganization: Purdue University\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 18\n\n>In article <1993Apr22.145940.1@skcla.monsanto.com> mas@skcla.monsanto.com writes:\n>>If you put a locking lugnut on your tires, do you need to have your\n>>tires rebalanced??\n>>\n>>John Mas\n>>\n>>\n>>E-Mail Address     ::     MAS@SKCLA.MONSANTO.COM\n>>\n>\n\nI bought a set of ARE's a few months back and decided to add locks\nso that I could keep my new rims.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's\n    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn's rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment.

It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n\"mainly about.\"\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\n\n> Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \n> of certainty.

As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\n\n> The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\n> make this simple test.

When\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\nresearchers' minds.  \n\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\nwants to become this generation's Rhine.\n\n> One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \n> unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't \n> been described in a scientific journal. ...\n\nI think this is absurd.  \n\n> Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done \n> (with favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because\n> it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\neases one's defense.)\n\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.

All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\nheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.\n\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\nbrutally murdered.\n\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\nunder the double-bed.\n\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\nwere all wounded.\n\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\n\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\nAyshe and her daughter.\n\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\n\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\ndetention. They then released me.\"\n\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\n\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\ndays.\n\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\nterrible sights.\n\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\nchild's bicycle lay in a corner.\n\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\n\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\nhead.\n\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\n\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\n\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\n\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\n\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

The first attempt failed in the summer\n\tof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\n\tstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\n\tafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\n\tThis is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\n\tcomp.os.os2.bugs.\n\n\tThis document contains:\n\t*  the background showing the need for these proposals\n\t*  the proposed charters for these proposals\n\t*  voting instructions\n\t*  a voting ballot\n\t*  some example ballots\n\t*  the voting rules\n\t*  the voting schedule\n\t*  the Mass Acknowledgement\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\tThe creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\n\tand emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\n\ta continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\n\tas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\n\tmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\n\tallowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\n\n\tMuch of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\n\tlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\n\tnumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility\n\twith their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\n\tavailability of drivers for their hardware, installation\n\tprocedures, etc.\n\n\tMultimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\n\tMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\n\tincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\n\t2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\n\n\tAny non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\n\tespecially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\n\tSo far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\n\t(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\n\tfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\n\tcomp.os.os2.misc for details).\n\n\nProposed Charters:\n\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\n\t\tas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\n\t\tspur additional development.  The group will also cover\n\t\ttopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\n\t\tWindows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\n\t\tportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\n\t\tso forth.\n\n\t(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tTo keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\n\t\torthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\n\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\n\t\tfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\n\t\ttechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\n\n\t(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\n\t\tavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,\n\t\tinstallation procedures, system requirements, and overall\n\t\tperformance optimization.\n\n\t(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\n\n\t(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\n\t\tdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\n\t\tpatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\n\n\t\t[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\n\t\tnewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.beta]\n\n\nHow to Vote:\n\n\tTo cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\n\tMany newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\n\tpost.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of\n\tthis post.\n\n\t1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:\n\n\t    If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \"yes\" after its name.\n\t    If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \"no\" after its name.\n\t    To abstain, leave a blank after its name.\n\n\t2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and\n\t    your first name (i.e. your personal name).\n\n\t3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the\n\t    ballot.\n\n\t4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm\n\t    (Central Time), April 24, 1993.\n\n\nBallot:\n\n----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----\n\n        (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:\n        (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:\n        (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:\n        (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n        (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:\n\n        (f)       voter's last, first name:\n\n        e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24\n\n----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------\n\n\nExample Ballot #1:\n\n\t(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n\t(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n\t(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no\n\t(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n\t(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no\n\n\t(f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John\n\n\tIn this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting\n\tto be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to\n\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of\n\tcomp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view\n\ton the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. \n\n\nExample Ballot #2:\n\n\t(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n\t(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n\t(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes\n\t(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes\n\t(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes\n\n\t(f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane\n\n\tIn this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all\n\tthe proposals.\n\n\nVoting Rules:\n\n\t* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most\n\t  recent vote will be counted.\n\n\t* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,\n\t  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.\n\n\t* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings\n\t  will be revealed only after the poll closes.\n\n\t* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will\n\t  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).\n\n\t* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how\n\t  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.\n\t  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is\n\t  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.\n\n\t* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this\n\t  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.\n\n\t* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal\n\t  passes if both of the following formulas are true:\n\t  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes\n\t      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).\n\t  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the\n\t      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).\n\t  In other words, a proposal passes if:\n\t      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)\n\t  where max() returns the highest number given to it.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\tThe voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted\n\tby David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).\n\n\tThis third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the\n\tMass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who\n\thave already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you\n\thave not voted yet, vote now!\n\n\tThe voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on\n\tApril 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.\n\tThe voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that\n\tdate.\n\n\nMass Acknowledgement:\n\n\tHere is the list of people who have already

I found I was overdoing\nit (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after\nspreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not\nthe usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so\nthey were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the\nadjusting screw a bit.

However, when it comes\nto the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs,\nthere is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the\ndoctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the\ntexts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be.\nAccording to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.\n\nTherefore, when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and\nthinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the\nBible, people consider him a cult.\n"}, {"text": "From: ladislas@sobeco.com (Ladislas A.)\nSubject: FAQ's ??\nOrganization: Sobeco Ernst & Young\nLines: 5\n\n\nCould someone repost the FAQs for this group, please?\n\nThanks\nLadislas.\n"}, {"text": "From: yatrou@INRS-Telecom.Uquebec.CA (Paul Yatrou)\nSubject: Re: Stewart homered the Wings!!\nOrganization: Bell-Northern Research Montreal, Canada.\nLines: 25\n\nIn <andy.bgsu.edu-250493225109@m248-100.bgsu.edu> andy.bgsu.edu (Ryan ) writes:\n\n>  Paul Stewart called *the* single worst game I've seen this year.\n> Federov's major was obvious, and I don't dispute it.  \n>However, Chaisson's penalty shouldn't even have been a penalty, let alone\n> a major and a game misconduct.\n>\n\nI don't \"notice\" refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around, and\nyes I have to agree that Stewart called the *two* worst games I've seen\nso far (Mtl-Quebec game 1, and last nights Toronto-Detroit game).\n\nWhat's the scoop on this guy?

My\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\n\nRunning MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the\nfollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified\nexplanation.\n\nTechnically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer\nadapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that\n\"Something's happening here, please take note.\" How the CPU is\nprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.\nIn MS-DOS, the \"interrupt vector\" is used to store the address of the\nfunction that handles each interrupt.\n\nNow, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready\nto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When\nDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,\nwait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to\nthe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's\nfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. \n\nWith any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing\napproach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU\ncycles.) Hence, you can't \"share\" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're\nrunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.\n\nAnother issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses\ninterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what\nto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is\nrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is\nneeded.\n\nYou can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use\nthem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine\nis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came\nfrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.\n\nRemember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the\ngeneral picture correctly enough.\n\nCheers,\n\n-- \n               Juha Liukkonen, aka jliukkon@cc.helsinki.fi\n              University of Helsinki,  Dept. of  Lost Souls\n           \"Trust me, I know what I'm doing.\" - Sledge Hammer\n"}, {"text": "From: kerch@parc.xerox.com (Berry Kercheval)\nSubject: Re: CGA for windows 3.1\nOrganization: Xerox PARC\nLines: 15\n\nsat@eng.tridom.com (Stephen Thomas) writes:\n>In article 6af@uniwa.uwa.edu.au, ngolding@tartarus.uwa.edu.au (Neil Golding) writes:\n>>I`m looking for some assistance in locating information on how to run\n>>win 3.1 on a CGA monitor. \n>The CGA driver for Windows 3.0 works fine with Win3.1. \n\n\nOh no!

They looked at the OT, NT and\nintertestimental usages of terms in reference.  I would suggest you read those\nbefore you talk about a \"need\" in exegetical studies.  If those aren't enough,\nI could also provide \"The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai\".  Dr James\nDeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of '92.  To read\nany of these 4 papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need\nfor honest exegesis.\n\nAgain, please refer to the faq file, or if you are unable to acess it, drop me\na line and I will enclose them to you.\n\nRexlex@fnal.fnal.gov \n\n[They're in a separate file, which I gave a pointer to in my posting\nyesterday.  --clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: <34AEJ7D@CMUVM.BITNET>\nSubject: Re: Who's next?
