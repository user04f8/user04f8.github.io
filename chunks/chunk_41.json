What happens is that the inside of my throat starts\nto feel \"puffy\", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my\nmouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.\n\nThe situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants\n(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food\nchain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese\nfast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of\nwhat looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.\n\nI am under the impression that MSG \"enhances\" flavor by causing the\ntaste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable\nto assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.\n\nAlso, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)\ninvolved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is\nwhat I suspect as being the cause.\n\nI wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals\nshowed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab\nrat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.\n\nAnyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are\ntotally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied\nthey know of.

The attempts to quiet any violence\n    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder\n    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and\n    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\n\n\n>The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population\n>density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.\n>The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\n>Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\n>strip and seek work in Israel.\n\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\n    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to\n    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\n    racist ommission on your part.\n\n\n>While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\n>Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\n>the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\n>Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\n>\n>The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is\n>recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of\n>justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to\n>rise up against its tormentors.\n\n    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is\n    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have\n    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave\n    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the\n    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing\n    but an anti-Israel charade.\n\n\n>As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of\n>Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are\n>considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops\n>and fields. \n\n    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli\n    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials\n    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your\n    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan\n    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as\n    collaborators.\n\n\n\t     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in\n>Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for\n>the Master Race.\n\n    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you\n    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of\n    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the\n    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have   \n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \n    \n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \n    race,' for you to avoid...\n\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\n    in Lebanon.  \n\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\n\n\n>The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the\n>right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the\n>occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some\n>Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over\n>Gaza through Arab collaborators.\n\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\n    manner.\n\n\n>As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible\n>with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming\n>Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for\n>self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish\n>society does not consider Gazans full human beings. \n\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?

Do you have an\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \n\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe\n    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born\n    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is\n    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \n    appear to be.

Goodspeed published it in a book called \n\"The Apocrypha\". Most any bookstore will have this. At any rate, the Jews \nof Christ's day had this book. It is a story mostly centered around the\nson of Tobit who was named Tobias. There was a young lady, Sarah, who had \nentered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. The brothers \nall died in the chamber before consumating the marriage.\n\nTobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife (3:17) because Tobias was\nher only relative and \"...she was destined for [Tobias] from the beginning\"\n(6:17).\n\nTobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. The \nseven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. That does not \neliminate Tobias, her eighth husband. Tobit is a fun and interesting \nstory to read. It's kind of a mythical romance. It's a little shorter \nthan Esther.\n\nThe LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20.

The number of characters\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\nX\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:\t1993\nXfix:\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\nXtitle:\ttitle of entry  \t\t    (see comments below)\nXentry:\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\nXdate:\tDate/time of submission in UTC\t    (see comments below)\nXhost:\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\nX\tUse tab indented lines if needed\nX---remark---\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\nX---author---\nXname:\tyour name\nXorg:\tSchool/Company/Organization\nXaddr:\tpostal address\nX\tuse tab indented lines to continue\nX\tdon't forget to include the country\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\nXanon:\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\nX---info---\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\nX---build---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\nX---program---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\nXinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\nX---end---\nX\nX      Regarding the above format:\nX\nX\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\nX\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\nX\nX\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\nX\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\nX\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\nX\nX\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\nX\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() \nX\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\nX\nX\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\nX\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the \nX\t  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same \nX\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be \nX\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\nX\nX\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above \nX\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\nX\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\nX\t  Email message to the judges.\nX\nX\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless \nX\t  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.\nX\nX\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\nX\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX\t* The entry's remarks should include:\nX\t    - what this program does\nX\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX\t    - information about any ---data--- files\nX\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX\t* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They \nX\t  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple \nX\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by '.c'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is\nX       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:\nX\nX\t\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate\nX\t\tobfuscate@toad.com\nX\nX       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.\nX\nX       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries\nX       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.

Each entry\nX       must be sent in a separate Email letter.\nX\nX   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  \nX       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.\nX\nX   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,\nX       special owner or group) are not allowed.\nX    \nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\nX    the entry against the size rules.\nX\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX    \nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

They are: 1) humans are animal\n\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\n\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\n\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\n\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\n\tstructure with biology at the apex).\n\n\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\n\tunderlying presuppositions.\n\n>Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are \n>because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life\n>a safety blanked to hide behind.  \"Oh wow..all i have to do is \n>follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\"\n>For all of you \"found jeezus\" , how many of you were \"on the brink?\"\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n>but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its\n>infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian\n>group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which\n>basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n>We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we\n>die.      \n\n\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\n\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\n\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\n\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\n\n>Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.\n\n\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\n\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\n\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\n\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\n\tknit relationship with this appelation.\n\n>Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject\n>themselves with jeezus and live with that high. \n\n\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\n\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\n\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\n\tthings flow.\n\n>It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious\n>wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.\n\n\tGuilty by association?

Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus \nexpression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this  \nrecombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus \ndoes in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in \npatients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune \nresponses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and \nCD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.

In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-\nantibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific \nactivation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  \nmay contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 \nbinding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added \nsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, \nstimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune \nfunction.

Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the \nmedical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug \nabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  \nThere were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  \nwere deceased.

People who contract TB usually \ndevelop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria \nagain.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight \noff a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's  \nhypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to \nAIDS, \"a hindrance to public health initiatives.\"   However, their hypothesis \nthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  \nThe U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, \nno prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this \nhypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  \ndepletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies \nagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals \nfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug-\nAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-\nfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  \nuse altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to \nproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years \nHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same \nAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.

Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  \nThe researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with \nhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  \nprofound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the \nobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had \ncirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the \nend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, \ncontained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  \naminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, \nhomologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  \nThese autoantibodies, which also  recognize \"native\" class II molecules and \nmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells \"in vivo\", were at low tires \n(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  \nautoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and \nHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss \nin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful \n\"autoimmune\" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA \nantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell \ncounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  \nrapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with \nthese HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude. \n       ================================================================   \n                                April 23, 1993 \n       ================================================================    \n\"TB Makes a Comeback\" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   \n(Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) \n\n     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United \nStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, \nminorities, and prisoners.

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because \nthose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with \ntreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public \nhealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic \"because the number of \ncases  is increasing faster than we can treat people,\" said Dr. George  \nDiferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to \nDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of \ndiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City \nresidents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their  \nmedication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more \nexpensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to \ntreat.\n ================================================================    \n \"Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern \nFlorida: Artifact or Reality?\" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. \n83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) \n\n     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in \nsouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write \nOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  \nThe researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal \nPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual \ntransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, \nor  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route \nof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records \nfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually \ntransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor \nwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  \nstandardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were \nreviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission \ncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the \npercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties \nbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to \nheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men \nand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  \nheterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after \nadjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the \nnational average, the researchers  conclude.\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                                AIDS Statistics\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                            World Health Organization, Geneva\n                        Organisation mondiale de la Sante, Geneve\n\n                              WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD\n                           RELEVE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE HEBDOMADAIRE\n\n15 January 1993 -
