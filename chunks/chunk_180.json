I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked\nit, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is\nalso too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels\nare rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do\nwith tarrifs being lifted I think). \n\nIn Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about\n$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For\nthat kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam\nprojector, but sacrifice portability.\n\nOh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you\nwant your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that\nlight wash out your display at the front of the room.

You are not at position to judge people because\nyou are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities.\nMillions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen,\ntheir rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under\nthe Government of Greece.

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\n                                 END11:45 A.M.

It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then\nthe people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I'm not bagging on these teams\nits just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would\nbe subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh.

The latter was written with\n    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind\n    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).\n\n    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John\n    Snyder's USGS publication \"Map Projections--A Working Manual\", USGS\n    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32\n    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both\n    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a\n    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.\n\n    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,\n    \"An Album of Map Projections\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This\n    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are\n    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.\n\n    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:\n    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National\n    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS.

He repeatedly emphasized\nhis view that ``regardless of what has been tried, or who has tried\nit, or how long they've been trying it, this is Day One to me.''\nThe audience at the convention, whose theme is ``How do we spell\nfiscal relief?  F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E,'' interrupted Clinton frequently\nwith applause.\n        Clinton's program, presented in the speech, follows the\noutline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level Drug\nCzar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  He did,\nhowever, cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement\nmethods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,''\nClinton said.  In particular, his administration will place strict\ncontrols on data formats and protocols, and require the registration\nof so-called ``cryptographic keys,'' in the hope of denying drug\ndealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said the\napproach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground\neconomic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders who\nlive in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.''\n        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won\n``because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last\nNovember, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of\nurgency about fighting the drug menace.  The advocates of\nlegalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good at\nmaking noise,'' Clinton said.  ``But when the American people cast\ntheir ballots, it only proved what I knew all along -- that the\nadvocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: nmohan@opal.tufts.edu\nSubject: SALE-CANON EOS ELAN OUTFIT\nLines: 28\nOrganization: Tufts University - Medford, MA\n\nFOR SALE\nCANON EOS ELAN OUTFIT\n\nINCLUDED \n-EOS elan body\n-28-80 mm EF 1:3.5-5.6 USM lens\n-100-300 mm EF 1:4.%-5.6 USM lens\n-2 B&W UV filters\n-Hoya circular polarising filter\n-Canon RC-1 remote controller\n-Pentax lens cloth\n-Lowe Pro camera bag\n-Galen Rowell Photoflex lens bag\n-Sapre lithium battery\n-Hove Foto bokk user guide to Canon EOS elan\n\nAll as new condition\n\nThe whole lot $800 (firm)\n\nContact David 617-227-7326\n              617-956-6905\n\n\nPlease do not e-mail your queries.

In both cases, I personally have _no_ problems with\nthe outcome, but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the \nworld community claims to revere so, why isn't it interfering there? \n\n|> the U.S. or any other democracy wishes to, they are in the perfect right to \n|> help them without any whining from thir parties.

My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save\nourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their\nproblems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked \nin the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left\nin 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to. Was it a success? Well,\nlook at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. It _was_\na success so long as the US was in, from what I remember. But it didn't last\nlong, obviously.\n\n|> >There is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit\n|> >in judgement of another people, and to then act on it.

However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II\nfrom an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes\nto go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he\ncan relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance,\nan anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and\nAnthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was an\nactor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner\nand based his acting and directing methods on Steiner's indications.  Part\nof the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well,\ngoing to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another\nPolish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about\nAnthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask\nhim what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said, \n\"Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in \nreincarnation,\" and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times\nto modern times.  Then he changed the subject.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\n format and renderer.\n\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\n\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\n those which help us get our work done.\n\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\n modification of the user program.

The Shephard's Rod (now \ndefunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.\n\nThe Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the \nSDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they \nwere the remnant spoken about in Revelation.\n\nAbout the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once \nin control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as \nChrist.\n\nKoresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young \nadult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over \nthe youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.\n\nThey were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of \nweapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US \ngovernment or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were \nputting themselves in a self defense position.  \n\nIn my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn'\nt have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.\n\nIf you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the \nlocal SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you \nsome insight into where Koresh got his theology.\n\nTammy\n"}, {"text": "From: hudson@athena.cs.uga.edu (Paul Hudson Jr)\nSubject: Re: Homosexuality issues in Christianity\nOrganization: University of Georgia, Athens\nLines: 35\n\nIn article <May.6.00.35.17.1993.15441@geneva.rutgers.edu> loisc@microsoft.com (Lois Christiansen) writes:\n>In article <Apr.30.03.11.27.1993.10101@geneva.rutgers.edu> FSSPR@acad3.alaska.edu wrote:\n\n>You might visit some congregations of Christians, who happen to be homosexuals,\n>that are spirit-filled believers, \n\nGifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior.\nA lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.

Today he\nsmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique\nI'd never seen before.\n\nHe took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.\nThe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,\nmade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.\n\nIn the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar\nquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two\nteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.\n\nOn top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with\ntwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.\n\nLater, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises\nand concerns me are:\n\n1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?\n\n2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color\n    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring\n    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected\n    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,\n    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being\n    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?\n\n3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated\n    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever\n    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea\n    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do\n    so.\n\nWRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),\nI've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\nstopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.\n\nMy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight\nstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\nof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,\njust leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?\n\nI also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill\nnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this\nduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals\nat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the\nfloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.\n\nAnd yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\nsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains\nnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually\nhas some standing, don't know about the others.\n\nAn amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was\ndiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting\na lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.\nThis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.\nThe guy who represented the company in the press conference defended\nhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day\nfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-\nbroiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my\nimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!

I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is\nessentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil\nliberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\ninvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\nreason.\n\nWhen I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\nauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\nsecurity point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\nthe problem.\n\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\nAuditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\nauditee can say, \"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\"  It\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's\njob.\n\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets\naway that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\nliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\nBut they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\nand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\n\nThere are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\nplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\nautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\nwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\nwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\n\nI believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\nsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\nchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\ntoday, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can\nbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\nlegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\nput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\nconflict of interest.\n\nAs always, my opinions are my own.\n\nLynn Grant\nGrant@Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL\n"}, {"text": "From: wright@duca.hi.com (David Wright)\nSubject: Re: Name of MD's eyepiece?\nOrganization: Hitachi Computer Products, OSSD division\nLines: 21\nNNTP-Posting-Host: duca.hi.com\n\nIn article <19387@pitt.UUCP> geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) writes:\n>In article <C4IHM2.Gs9@watson.ibm.com> clarke@watson.ibm.com (Ed Clarke) writes:\n>>|> |It's not an eyepiece.
