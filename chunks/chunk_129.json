This was passed by Congress in the\n1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased\ndetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.\n\nThis is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very\nweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are\nbanned.\n\nThis also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a\ntime back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,\nand never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned.\nThis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.\n\nIf it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone\nwould do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates\nthat enforcement is still in effect.\n\nAn odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as \"gumbo file'\".\nThis is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This\nis not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural\nform, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption\nwas made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats.\n"}, {"text": "From: tne@world.std.com (Thomas N Erickson)\nSubject: Re: TeleUse, UIM/X, and C++\nOrganization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA\nLines: 20\n\nhubec@ctp.com (Hubert Chou) writes:\n\n>Does anyone have any good ideas on how to integrate C++ code elegantly\n>with TeleUse, UIM/X / Interface Architect generated code?\n\n>Source would be great, but any suggestions are welcome.\n\n\nAlsys has produced a paper outlining how to use C++ with TeleUSE.

Presbyterian\nand Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical\nlanguages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral\nprogram in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But\nthere are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the\nattitude seems to be more, \"Well, if you're *really* interested we'll give you\na semester-long course, but we don't understand why . . .\")\n\nThe pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year\nstudents to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each\nlanguage, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (That is: Hebrew in\nAugust, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.) \nThese courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students,\nI'd say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work.\n"}, {"text": "From: aafc6@syma.sussex.ac.uk (Nightline)\nSubject: Editres under Pie(TVT)wm\nKeywords: editres twm failure\nOrganization: University of Sussex at Brighton\nLines: 14\n\nHi, looking for any advice or suggestions about a problem I'm\nhaving with MIT X11R5's editres, in particular under twm variants.\n\nFor a start, 9 times out of 10 (but NOT always) editres won't\ngrab a widget tree when running on our NCD (Decwindows) Xterms,\nwhich I'm told will be fixed when the R5 (not R4) XDm is installed.\nOK, so I tried running it on a Sun, running real R5, on the same\nnetwork - I get a widget tree, but it's ALWAYS for 'TWM Icon Manager'\n\nAnybody know of any patches for (a) twm or (b) editres that I should\nlook at?\n\nThanks,\nK\n"}, {"text": "From: 35002_2765@uwovax.uwo.ca\nSubject: CBC: Canadian for ESPN.\nOrganization: University of Western Ont, London\nNntp-Posting-Host: hydra.uwo.ca\nLines: 19\n\nHooray, I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game, Selanne\ngetting a hat-trick!\n\nOf course, here in GOD'S COUNTRY (read Ontario!)

Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,\nbecause I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.\n\tBasically, there are a number of functions with prototypes\nset up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite\nwidget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :\n\n\ttypedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)\n\nbut in several places in the HP source code, they reference the\ninsert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just\none, as the prototype suggests.

Igor and I had thought that if it was \na girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, \nwe'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without\nIgor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.\n\nOur family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew \nup together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. \nIn 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in \nSumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,\nSeryozha, is four and a half.\n\nFirst I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from \nwork I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were \nKomsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were \nboth Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were \nshouting, \"There's no room for Christians here!\" and \"When we finish with the \nArmenians, we'll go after the Russians!\" And some even cried Out, \"Death to \nthe Armenians!\" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became \nfrightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen \ndowntown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich \nMelkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he \nreturned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was \nsmashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I \nwas telling him everything, too, and he said, \"What, is there no longer any\ngovernment?\" That same day Igor said, \"Papa, something terrible is happening \nin the city.\" And he said, \"We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our \nown home.\"\n\nThe day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called \nour relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the \nsame thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an \nArmenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I \ncalled the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and \nnonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything.\n\nOn February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were \nafraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I \ntold the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't \nbe coming in. He agreed, and even said, \"Fine, don't come in, we understand \nwhat's going on in town, don't come in.\"\n\nBefore that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my \nfather-in-law and said, \"Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are \nhappening in town.\" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, \"With my own eyes I \nsaw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know,\" he said, \"we \nshould leave town.\" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we \nshould go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, \nclothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the \nbuilding manager came by and said, \"Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is \nbad, don't go out.\" My father even opened up to him and said, \"Maybe we'll \ndrive to the dacha, it'll be safer there.\" \"No,\" he said, \"it'll be worse \nthere, you'll be safer at home.\" He said don't be afraid, if something happens \nI'll send people to save you.\n\nAfter he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our \ncourtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two \nchildren, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my \nmother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of \nthem, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started\nbreaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, \"Go in that room\nand close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear\nthat there's anyone home.\" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my \nbrother-in-law's wife, suggested, \"Let's run out onto the balcony.\" We -- the\ntwo daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out\nonto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, \n\"Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all.\" We lived on the\nsecond floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At\nfirst we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time\npeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I \npleaded and begged: \"Please, call someone, have someone come!\" I even started \nshouting. \"I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them \nand take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive.\" Either they \nwere afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were \nwatching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it \nagain, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the \nbuilding and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A \nbus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing\nover to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children \nover there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet \nseven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; \nyou know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, \nand Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and \ncrying. My Kristina said, \"Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're \nafraid!\" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina \ndidn't even want to climb over. She shouted, \"I'm staying with Grandmother,\nI'm staying with Grandma!\" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And \nmy mother-in-law shouted, \"Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there, \nsave Kristina, too!\" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira \nhelped us and went back inside.\n\nWe started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist, \nSevil, open the door, open it, please!\" She didn't open it. \"No, go away, go \nanywhere, go, I'm not opening the door.\" She was our neighbor, we were \nfriends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we \nwere going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and \nsaid, \"Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll \nkill us, too, because of you.\" I begged, \"Please, at least take the children, \nwe'll leave, we'll go back.\" \"No,\" she said, \"you have to leave.\" Her sons ran \nin, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: \"Get out \nof here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!\" I became terrified, I took the \nchildren and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down \nand heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard \"The Armenians must be \nkilled, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!\" One of \nthem said, \"Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!\" When I \nheard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their \ndoor for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any \nlonger. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, \nthat they would save her.\n\nMy head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next \nentryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a \nhalf. They were crying, \"Mamma, we're scared!\" They were so frightened that I \ndidn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was \nawful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, \"Open up, let \nme inside!\" He opened the door slightly and said, \"No!\" \"No\" and that was it! \nHe said it so sternly: \"No!\" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists \non the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood \nthere, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get \ndown on my knees. \"Please, I beg of you, at least take the children.\" He \nwasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me \ninside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't \npassed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want \nto open the door. And again I started pleading, \"Please, open the door, it's \nour Ira and Lilia! Open the door!\" And he said, \"No, I'm afraid.\" I said again \nand again, \"Please, open the door, please!\" He looked at me. He looked at me \nfor a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We \nthrew ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into \nthe bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, \"Calm \nthe children, and calm yourselves down, too.\"\n\nCalm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in \nour apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I \nsaid, \"Igor, Edik, let's say farewell.\" And Edik turned around and looked at \nme as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would \nkill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They \nstarted pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that \nhe had told us, \"Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight.\" He thought we \nwere in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: \n\"Edik, Igor, let's say farewell.\" Igor didn't think we could climb over to the \nother balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were \nable to save ourselves.\n\nIgor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All \nthe men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next \nto the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from \nthe other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: \"Open the door!\" We \nwere all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, \"They're home,\nthey're in there, break down the door!\" And I remember my father-in-law \nwhispering, \"They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . \"\n\nHe had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were \ngoing to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal \nchair legs. From outside the door they said, \"We're counting to five, open \nup!\" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was \nhome. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law \nhad said, \"It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be? \nEveryone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with \neveryone.\" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani \nguest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there \noften, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save \nourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, \"I'm not \nleaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight \nalongside them.\" That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, \n\"If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight \nalongside my family, I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nWe were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and \nshouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor \nat the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's \nvoice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a \nlong time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: \"Open the \ndoor, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's \nher voice!\" But the Lezgin said, \"It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in \nyour apartment.\" He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and \nthe Lezgin opened the door and said, \"Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran \naway.\" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him \noutside, next to the building.\n\nWhile we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The \nway Ira shouted! She shouted, \"Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!\" \nShe repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many \npeople there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, \nwhistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.\n\nApparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway \nwhere we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I \ndon't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in\nparticular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed \nover the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law \nwere climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming \nup the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were \nour last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. \nThey were sleeping. I woke them up: \"Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!\" And I tell \nIra: \"Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony.\" We \nwere on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door \ntoo, because later he said, \"I opened the door and told them there were no \nArmenians inside.\" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the \nbalcony himself to see: they were gone.\n\nWe weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from \nthe building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider \nhiding us.\n\nThe Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, \n\"Karina, there're no lights on in our block.\" The whole block was dark, the \nwhole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, \"I'm afraid to keep\nyou until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving\nyou.\" I said, \"What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave\nwith the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere\nelse to hide.\" He said, \"Well OK, go look.\" I asked Ira, \"Ira, do you want to\ngo?\" Ira said, \"No, I'll stay with the children, Karina.\" I said, \"Fine, then\nI'll go.\" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one \nwas in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at \nafter seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never \nwent out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a\nslaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the \nboarding school and my director answered. He said, \"Karina, where are you?\" I\ndidn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I \nwas. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what \ntime it was, I asked him, \"What time is it?\" He said 11:20, I think, but I \ndon't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I \nlook and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there\nwas the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse \nfor a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen \ngrabbed my hand and squeezed it: \"Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on, \nwhat are you turning around for?\" I turned around and saw a large truck, it \nmust have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck \nlike that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the \nfourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police \nthen they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the \npolice station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, \"Soldier, in \nBlock 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to \nsave them!\" And he said, \"Go to the police station and tell them everything.\" \nI said, \"I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them.\" He said, \"Don't be \nafraid.\"\n\nWe went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military \nvehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the \npolice station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that \nthey'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to\nthem.\n\nAfter a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us \nto the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they \ntook us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, \nvery many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was \nonly wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, \nnothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.\n\nThe Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably \nalive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of \nSumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came \nand told us, \"Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party \nCommittee.\" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for \nsix days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee \nand waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira \nhad only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went \nby. And then one of the functionaries told us, \"Karina, Ira, gather your \ncourage. Would you like to go to the burial?\" I said, \"What, did they really \nkill all of them?!\" He said, \"Let's look.\" He had a long list, and he started \nreading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-\nlaw, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,\nand Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, \n\"Get in the car, let's go to the burial.\"\n\nWe buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive\nof it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my \nchildren when they're older?\n\nMy children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and\ngrandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and\ngrandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, \"My grandma is \nbetter than anyone!\" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's \ndifficult for her, and once she told her: \"You're a bad grandmother.\"\n\nI don't know why, I asked her, \"Kristina, where's Papa?\" and she said, \"They \nkilled him.\" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded\nSeryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, \"When Papa \ncomes I'm going to tell him everything!\"\n\nJuly 26, 1988\nNairi Boarding House\nNear the Village of Arzakan\nHrazdan District\nArmenian SSR\n\t\t\t- - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Buehler)\nSubject: Re: The doctrine of Original Sin\nOrganization: none\nLines: 42\n\nRegarding the consequences of the original sin:\n\nCatholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin, for\nhimself and the human race, was sanctifying grace.  This is basically\na share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk:\nwhat God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.\nIt makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers\nof any possible creature.  This is the \"everlasting life\" that the New\nTestament speaks of.\n\nWhat Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying\ngrace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by\nwhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.\n\nThe absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion\nfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it's impossible for a\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither\ncan human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.\n\nThis all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since\nboth have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot\nenter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they\ncannot enter into Heaven.\n\nTurning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the\nCatholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some\nchange in an infant's soul, there is no particular reason to insist on\nthe practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the\nApostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly\nthereafter.\n\nThere is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself: 1\nCor 1:16, Acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also Acts 11:14.  It is known for\nsure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an\ninfant: St. Polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his\nmartyrdom).  St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as\ninfants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus's \"Against\nHeresies\", and in Tertullian's \"On Baptism\".  All these so far\nmentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord's death.  After\nthat, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.\n"}, {"text": "From: GWGREG01@ukcc.uky.edu\nSubject: Re: Pregnency without sex?\nNntp-Posting-Host: ukcc.uky.edu\nOrganization: The University of Kentucky\nX-Newsreader: NNR/VM S_1.3.2\nLines: 27\n\nIn article <C6BotF.137@r-node.hub.org>\ntaob@r-node.hub.org (Brian Tao) writes:\n \n>In article <1993Apr27.182155.23426@oswego.Oswego.EDU>, Harry Matthews writes...\n>>\n>> I've heard of community swimming pools refered to as PUBLIC URINALS so what\n>> else is going on?\n>\n>    Do you swim nude in a public swimming pool?  :)  I doubt sperm can\n>penetrate swimsuit material, assuming they aren't immediately dispersed\n>by water currents.\n>--\n>Brian Tao:: taob@r-node.hub.org (r-Node BBS, 416-249-5366, FREE!)\n>::::::::::: 90taobri@wave.scar.utoronto.ca (University of Toronto)\n \nHere we go again.\n \n========================================================================\n \nU   UK   K UNIVERSITY                                 GARY W.
