My\n\tpoint is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing\n\tthis year.  This year we had more skill, I'm all for that, but\n\tif your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they\n\tcan't do you much good.  Whether it's a cheap shot or not you\n\tcan't let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharks\n\tsimply got pushed around to much.

Sirach\nOrganization: University of Florida's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\nLines: 35\n\n\n\tWhat we call today the \"Old Testament\" was being written up to approx-\nimately 168 BCE, according to most modern scholars.  Aside from the book of\nDaniel, the whole OT predates Alexander (the Great).  These books were written\n(predominantly) in Hebrew.\n\tThere were also other books being written at about this time and later\nby Greek-speaking, or \"Hellenistic\", Jews.  These books are those which are\nreckoned by many denominations as \"Apocrypha\".\n\tBefore the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is today\ncalled the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day.  However,\nthere were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased.\nThis faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day.  They\nalso maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine\nteachings from God.\n\tBy the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.  Christians\nhad come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in\nsynagogues and used for worship.  Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders\ngot together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach)\nonward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.  In\nparticular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) were\nnot inspired.\n\tAt about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon in\nsomewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia.  A few books (Ecclesi-\nastes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were those\nwhich had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of Ben\nSira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian\nand Hellenistic writings.\n\tJerome excluded the 'apocrypha' because they were not in use by Jews\nof his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in his\ntime.  His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writings\nwas not based on 'inspiration'.\n\n\tThere is plenty more to say, but I do not have time.\n\tThe passage you quote concerns the book (Rev.) in which it is found.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrank D.\n"}, {"text": "Organization: Arizona State University\nFrom: James Cassidy <IFJXC@ASUACAD.BITNET>\nSubject:    Need specs for a Western Digital IDE HD\nLines: 9\n\nA friend of mine needs spec for a used hard drive he just got:\nIt is a Western Digital, IDE, 340 meg\nwith 1010 cylinders and 12 heads.

Both my wife and I suffered from \nbouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a \nrebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and \nchemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through \nher six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When \nsevere depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to \nuse supplements to bring her out of it.  I had \"cured\" her PMS using \nsupplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet \nin depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and \nshe was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after \nby wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and \none reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another \nstressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with \nsupplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. \nI was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using \nB6, niacin, folate and B12 to \"cure\" depression.  I'm not going to do that \nbecause all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.\n\nLida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the \nproblem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use \nan approach which will \"fix\" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly \nwhat drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be \naffected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these \nstressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was \npretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is \na nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your \nbodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), \nyou have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any \nnutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from \nbeing emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase \nyour need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become \nvery important.\n\nLida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to \ntry to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming \nfrom.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic \nMedical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because \nnone was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I \npreach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by \nmy students as sermons).

I last did this \nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \nI write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).\n\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\n\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \nto residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \npatient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \nPreface of this new text:\n\n\"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice.\"  \n\n\"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition.\"\n\n\"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.\"\n\n\"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \nevery organ system.\"\n\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \n\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Act).  \n\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \nto be the best approach to depression.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: gspira@nyx.cs.du.edu (Greg Spira)\nSubject: Re: Jack Morris\nOrganization: University of Denver, Dept. of Math & Comp.

Generally, these\ntelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,\nfor example, we have the following set regarding children:\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to\n\t the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum\n\t [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem\n\t families and received as servants when they are left alone through\n\t the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect\n\t all such children in your province and send them to the places of\n\t deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to\n\t the people.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [1]\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the\n\t time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their\n\t lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [2]\n\n\t\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.\n\n\t November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the\n\t orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their\n\t places of exile.\n\n\t \t\t\t\tAbdullahad Nuri. [3]\n\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been\n\t opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is\n\t done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt\n\t of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or\n\t any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it\n\t purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as\n\t detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received\n\t into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish\n\t special orphanages for them.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat.\" [4]\n\n\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\n\t Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures\n\t to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with\n\t the caravans.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [5]\n\n\t\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\t At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows\n\t of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is\n\t not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by\n\t Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble\n\t in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned\n\t out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of\n\t deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent\n\t away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.\n\n\t\t\t\tMinister of the Interior,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTalaat\" [6]\n\nIn 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs\nabout a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \"rationalizing\" this\nultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:\n\n\t\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for\n\t its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks\n\t it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I\n\t shall die for it.\" [7]\n\n\nThese telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of\nTalaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never\nquestioned these \"death march orders\" until 1986, during a time when the world\nwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.\n\nFor reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the\nTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were\never issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a\nstudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.\n\nIf one were to examine the sample \"authentic text\" provided in the Turkish \nHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it \ntoo would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the \nTurkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or \nPersian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is\na forgery. \n\nToday, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,\nTurkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide \narchitect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a \nheightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a\nfocal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.\n\nThis monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological\ndenial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only\ncrime was to be born Armenian.\n\n\t\t\t- - - references - - -\n\n[1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60\n\n[2] ibid, page 60\n\n[3] ibid, page 60\n\n[4] ibid, page 61\n\n[5] ibid, page 61\n\n[6] ibid, page 62\n\n[7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and\n    London), 1926, page 387\n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\nS.D.P.A.

But these were\nmiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - \"you've lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened\nto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\ndidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we'll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn\nV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.

If the FBI had\nhad the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type\nraid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.\nIt really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity \nto give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead\nhe ordered the murder of the children.\n\n\nIn order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive\nthe words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the \nsuicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given\nthe BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met\nby gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter\nclaim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the \nAFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier\ngrade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposes\nthey were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons.\n\n\nThe B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D were\nquite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any\ntime. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have\nachieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of \nmagintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes\nand Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch \napocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties\nthan 80.\n\nAllowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious\nrisk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the \nquestion of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over\na prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared\nKoresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go\nin prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.\n\n\nCan you think of a better way of getting the children out?\n\nA 100% certain way?\n\n\nThe people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire\ngovernment story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for \nthem to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require\nthem to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come\nup with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to\nset out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them\nto get gun control legislation through.\n\nThis conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its\nagents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the\nmiddle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters.\n\nStill the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that\nWACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in \nresolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a \ncomparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it\ncould be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it\nrests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular\nthe person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF\nagents and 17 children on his or her conscience.\n\n\nThere are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society\npreach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the\nvery people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO\nmay not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group\nof the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example\nand holding several hundred children hostage.\n\nThe only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent\nthem arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation. \nthis is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power\nweaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah\nto set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.\n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker\n"}, {"text": "From: cotera@woods.ulowell.edu\nSubject: Re: Biblical Backing of Koresh's 3-02 Tape (Cites enclosed)\nLines: 14\nOrganization: University of Massachusetts Lowell\n\nIn article <1r1u5t$595@lm1.oryx.com>, xcpslf@oryx.com (stephen l favor) writes:\n> : Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed\n> : for the message he carried.

I'm glad we (MS) are starting\nto remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future \nreleases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the \nmid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over\nthe world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS\n(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.\nThe theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people\nuntil they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the \nwayside.\n\nThen Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to\nbe doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either\nstayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that\npoint in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the\nshort term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS\n3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows.\nVersion 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will\noffer even more in terms of \"real\" OS features (I work on NT and have no\nreal clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do\nknow that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a\nfew years ago).\n\n\t...Dave\n\nOf course these are my opinions.

Basically it changes things\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\n   other users.\n\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\n\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\n\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\n\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\n\n    o User Interface Panels\n\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\n\tfaster frame rates)\n\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\n\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\n\n  Server(s):\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\n\n    o Transparent Client Management\n\n    o Client Message Handling\n\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\naccepting and\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\napplication writer\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\n\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\n\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\n        initialisers you want.\n\n    o Event Handler Registration:\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\n\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\n\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\n    from which to choose.\n\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\n\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\n        any initialization you want to do.\n\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\n\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\n\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\n\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\n\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\n    three world servers I've provided:\n\n        generic - 81 lines\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\n                           versions)\n        dogfight - 72 lines\n\nLocation:\n\n   This software is located at the following site:\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\n\n   Directory:\n   pub/virtual-worlds\n\n   File:\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\n\nFutures:\n\n   Client:\n\n    o Texture mapping.\n\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\n\n    o HMD support.\n\n    o Etc, etc....\n\n   Server:\n\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\n\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\n\n    o Etc, etc....\n\n   Both:\n\n    o Improved Comms!!!\n\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\nsoftware,\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\n\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\n\nFinally one major disclaimer:\n\nThis is totally amateur code.

It seems to me that he is arguing\nfor LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.\n\nNice job on the specificity of that one, too.\n\n\n\n[Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted] \n\n>        But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \n>cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \n>their propoganda.

Methinks that you\nmay be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it\nprimarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences\nof opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of\nconspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk\nresentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their\ngood fortune?\n\n\n\n>        On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \n>material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For \n>example:\n\nThis should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America\nthat is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People\nand business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh \nis the populist nemesis of that movement.\n\nI have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary\npiece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \"venom\"\nat all, let alone \"venom\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered\nmillions out of racism.\n\n\n\n>On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\n>        Hitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \n>individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \n>perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in \n>order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \n>imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \n>for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \n>thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \n>(page 577).\n\nA very serious tone in that oratory.\n\n\n\n>        Limbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The \n>show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \n>brain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \n>aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \n>with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media \n>will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \n>and screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\n\nYou neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, \nBTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather\nthan blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention \nthat he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.\nHe also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be\nintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).\nThis is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is\ntreated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.\n\nI am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just\nkidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and\nneeded to be exterminated.\n\n\n\n>On Religion as the Basis of a Nation\n>        Hitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \n>inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \n>decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \n>culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \n>sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \n>expulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\n\nThis is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since\nChrist was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of\nthe Aryan as \"the highest image of the Lord\" fits with Christian doctrine.\n\n\n\n>        Limbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \n>But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \n>ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \n>charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \n>for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \n>American education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\n\nPrivate religious schools have a vastly better record of success than\npublicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-\nChristian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent\nto Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching\njust a wee bit here.\n\n\n\n>On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\n>        Hitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \n>One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \n>theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \n>Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \n>must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \n>service of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\n\nDefinite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment\nindustry here.\n\n\n>        Limbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \n>Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \n>who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \n>and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\n\nJust a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate\ngovernment control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show\nto confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the\ndepraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control \nof Hollywood.\n\n90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control \nof our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an\nearly age the \"right\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. \nLimbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \"young heads full\nof mush\" hyperbole indicates.\n\n\n\n>On the News Meida\n>        Hitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \n>gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \n>by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the \n>people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \n>slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\n\nPretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for\ngovernment power to be used to break up the conspiracy.\n\n\n\n>        Limbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \n>bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \n>replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \n>the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \n>network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't \n>realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \n>therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \n>and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\n\nIndication here that \"Elements of the Media\" (since career is a self-selected\ncategorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in\nthe populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.\nNo insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only\nthat for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the\nsituation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.\n\nYou may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable \nopinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his \naudience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that \npurports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree \nor other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who \nis being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?\n\nAgain, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would\noppose government control of the media.\n\n\n\n>*     *     *\n        \n>To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \n>ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\n\nIt is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.\nLiberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people\nwho disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology\non an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?\nPerhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that\nthey exist in your mind, not the real world.\n\n\n\n>        After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \n>haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \n>Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \n>Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \n>Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \n>depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \n>radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \n>Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \n>The Fascist States of America.\n\nPerhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve\nRush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading\nlaughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.\n\nAs to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.\nMr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend\nof government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism\nin America through \"business/government partnership\" and increased levels\nof taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes\nin grade school.\n\n\n\n>        And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \n>radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \n>wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\n\nHmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler\nbecause he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of\nracism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to\nracism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear \nracism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal \nLeft.\n\nThe Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked\non the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized\nEducation, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to \nthat Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear\nto me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush \nLimbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than \nthe other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.\n\n\n>The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\n>0845; (608) 255-4460.\n>\n>--- 30 ---\n\nThis is the same address as \"Idiots Anonymous\", isn't it?\n\n\nMatt Freivald\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiBORGalism:\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.
