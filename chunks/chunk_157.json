Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries\nhave more power than you might realize, and you never know-\ncould be the dean of admissions answering the phone.\n\n> Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i\n\nIf you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate\nyourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing\nyou into medicine; your academic and extracurricular\naccomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really*\nwant to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out\nin the first semester of med school because they found it was\nnot what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four\nyears in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a\ncareer is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be\npushed into it because of your parents/family/significant\nother.  \n\nIf you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you\ncan improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from\na professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive\nrecommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous\nprofessor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't\nbe afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest\nand positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,\nsorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I\nhave turned down writing recommendations for some students\nbecause I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful\ncomments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them\nat that point.  \n\nRewrite your personal statement; take it by an English\nprofessor or some other friendly person with skill and\nexperience in writing and proof-reading and get their\ncriticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you\nsay it.\n\nReview your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor\nin some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further\ncoursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help\nhere.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut\ncourses, it usually shows.\n\nLook at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in\nlocal philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;\nsubstantial leadership roles in an organization help also.\nBeware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to\nspot and weed out.\n\nOverall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why\nyou want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal\nof skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in\napplying to any program, medical or what-have-you.\n\nGood luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting\nis the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)\n\nBob Schmieg\n"}, {"text": "From: gballent@vancouver.UVic.CA (Greg  Ballentine)\nSubject: Re: Winnipeg vs. Vancouver\nNntp-Posting-Host: vancouver.uvic.ca\nReply-To: gballent@vancouver.UVic.CA\nOrganization: University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada\nLines: 24\n\n\nIn article G2o@ccu.umanitoba.ca, umturne4@ccu.umanitoba.ca (Daryl Turner) writes:\n\n>Oh yeah...and I CAN go to the Arena and see not one, not two, but\n>*six* championship banners hanging from the rafters.  3 Stanley Cup\n>banners, and 3 Avco Cup banners.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for\nNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear sir:\n\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \nmomentus \"scientific\" findings. These are regularly released to the press\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\nserious studies by criminologists.\n\nThe latest effort -- \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\nA Tale of Two Cities,\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \neditorial, \"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\" by two employees\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\norder.\n\n\t1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \n\tsupport the statement that \"some have argued that restricting\n\taccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\n\tof homicide.\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\n\tcontention.\n\t\n\t2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\n\tsimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\n\tdemographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\n\tare very different with very different demographic characteristics\n\twhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\n\tSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\n\tand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\n\tthe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\n\tgrounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\n\tethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\n\t\n\t3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,\n\tcompared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all\n\tthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\n\tin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\n\t1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\n\tinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\n\tarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\n\thandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\n\tone must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\n\tthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\n\ta patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\n\tfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\n\tat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\n\t\n\t4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\n\tgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\n\tselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\n\tit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\n\treason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\n\tinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \"control\"?\n\tHad different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\n\t\"scientific\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide\n\trate *exceeds* that of such \"wild west\" cities in Texas as\n\tEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\n\tSprings. (Ref. 3)\n\t\n\t5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\n\thandguns \"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\n\tVancouver.\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\n\tto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\n\tan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\n\tpermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\n\tVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\n\thandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\n\towners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\n\tof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\n\tfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\n\tlegally for protection, registration figures are\n\tmeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\n\tCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\n\tthat method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\n\tin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\n\thas a greater \"prevalence of weapons\" than New York City.\n\t\n\tThe second method of measuring gun density is \"Cook's gun\n\tprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\n\tdifferences.\" But the validation was by Cook of his own\n\ttheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\n\tdifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\n\tbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\n\tin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\n\ta measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\n\t(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\n\thomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\n\tVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\n\tability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\n\tVancouver.\n\t\n\t6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\n\tCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\n\tWashington has a waiting period and background check prior to\n\tthe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\n\tlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personal\n\tprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\n\tdifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\n\tthe case.\n\t\n\t7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\n\tthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\n\tpenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \n\tclearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\n\tfirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\n\tof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\n\tarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\n\trates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\n\timposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\n\tor gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\n\tscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\n\tthe authors of the NEJM \"tale of two cities\" fail even to mention\n\tmost factors related to crime control.\n\t\n\t8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\n\tmeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\n\tthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\n\t650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\n\tcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\n\tliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\n\tcompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\n\tto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\n\treported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\n\twithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\n\taccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\n\tinvolving firearms.\n\t\n\t9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \"study,\"\n\teditorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \"applied\n\tscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\n\tadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\n\thandguns.\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\n\tbe mistaken for \"scientific methods\" by a sociologists or\n\tcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \"study\" is the equivolent\n\tof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\n\ttwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\n\tand the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\n\tadministering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\n\tgiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\n\tand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \n\tannouncing in a \"special article\" a new medical breakthrough.\n\tIt would be nice to think that such a \"study\" would neither be\n\tfunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\n\t\n\tSince the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\n\tmake them willing to present shoddy research as \"scientific\n\tbreakthroughs\" in \"special articles\" and editorials relating\n\tto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\n\tthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\n\tover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\n\tthe distortions contained in \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\n\tand Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"Firearm Injuries: A Call\n\tfor Science.\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\n\twhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\n\tan opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tREFERENCES\n\n1.

Wright\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\n\n      Someone once wrote: \"Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\"  The problem is demonstrated\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\n   suggested that a handgun ban \"may reduce the rate of homicide in a \n   community.\"\n      The nine medical doctors who published \"Handgun Regulations, Crime,\n   Assaults, and Homicide\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\n   Why?\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\n   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\n*     The second bit of evidence is \"Cook's gun prevalence index,\" which stands\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\n*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \"prove\" it on the basis of\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\n   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of\n   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the \n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \"similar in\n   many ways,\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \"all\n   else is equal\" among things being compared.\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\n*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\n*  in either city.\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \"gun availability\"\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\n   percentage?\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \"many ways\" might explain part\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\n*  result in a \"complex picture.\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\n*  also acknowledge that \"socio-economic status is probably an important\n*  confounding factor in our comparison,\" remarking further that \"blacks   \n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\n*  Vancouver's population.\"  Given the evidence presented in the article,\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\n*  since \"detailed information about household incomes according to race\n*  is not available for Vancouver.\"\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\n   account?  In this example, the \"hidden variable\" is city size: Guns are\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\n      In the editorial \"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\" accompanying\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\n   authors for applying \"scientific methods\" to a problem of grave public\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\n   is cause for further concern.\n\n   [James D.

In a recent\nissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It\nsaid:\n\n  \"There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer\nindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's.\"\n\n  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the \"cracker\" ethic, which is something\nentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the\nfree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is\nit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to\nhave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \n\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\n\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves \"hackers\"\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\ncomputer industry?\n\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.\n\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"       |\n|  \"Szechuan Death\"           |          - Khan Singh                        |\n|                             |            \"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\"|\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n"}, {"text": "From: wayne@r-node.hub.org (Wayne Dawe)\nSubject: Flexible solar cells\nOrganization: R-node Public Access Unix - 1 416 249 5366\nLines: 10\n\nTwo or three years ago I saw a report on TV about a company that had \ndeveloped a method of making solar cells on a flexible substrate.

Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse.\nIn both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the\nuser is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is\npaging out to disk, etc.\n\nWith newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder to\nisolate the fun parts.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He's hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\n                                                                                       \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+\n"}, {"text": "From: R5321GAB@vm.univie.ac.at\nSubject: Tel.# for 3D scanners needed!\nOrganization: University of Vienna\nLines: 13\nNNTP-Posting-Host: helios.edvz.univie.ac.at\n\nHello all,\n   I need to make  some torso 3D scans and would like the phone numbers of\ncompanies in the midwest that make scans, and the numbers of companies that\nmake the sanners (ie Cyberware).

No.  You know what the \"dealer invoice\"\n(also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numbers\non it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numbers\nsignify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that the\nsalesman can wave in your face to impress you.

I'd\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture\nwe have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy\nto identify with only a small segment of the population.

Dec. 1989\n\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\n\nThe diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main\ntissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to\nact before the Holocaust.\n\nHe said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure\nof Judaism\".\n\nHis talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000\nyears of Jewish history.\n\nMr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\nsaid \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews\noutside Israel \"who were using other people's countries like\nhotels\".\n\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\nelsewhere.\n\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\n\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\",\nended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in\nIsrael.\n\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\ncountry's political situation.\n\nHe said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\nproduced about the intifada.\n\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\n\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\nIsraeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood\ncharacter\".\n\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\n\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\ncountry they lived in, he said.\n\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\nliterary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English\nlanguage.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: aws@iti.org (Allen W.

Even the\ngreatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical\noddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust.\nMankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness\nthat transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the\nend.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little\npurposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others)\nsuffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at\nleast able to put it out of their minds.\n\nTo me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the\ntrue reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is\na school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That\ngives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure\noff.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms\nif you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress,\ngrow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your\nlove, especially when it's dificult to do so.

All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from\n Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly\n slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to\n save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful\n events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then\n taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people \n well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these\n places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.\n They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the\n Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality\n problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers\n who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and\n Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the \n Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. \n I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is \n destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air.

OK ?\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \n         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-\n         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \n         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\n         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\n         energy that carnot will give them.\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\n         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\n         \n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with\n         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\n         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \n\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have\n         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and\n         getting children with 2 heads.

If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe\nto USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company.

In the same way if a company decides that it has \npolitical objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political\nmanner.

Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\n\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\nindeed \"chorion.\" \n\nNow I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\n\n\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \n\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\n\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \nthink it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \"contradictions\" to \nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\nto support Mr Archer's contentions). \n\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\nBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\nadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\nwhich drives the point home). \n\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\ndiscussing the \"Potter's Field.\"\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\n\t\t\t\tHenry Ward Beecher\n\t\t\t\tAmerican Clergyman\n\t\t\t\tas recorded by George Seldes\n"}, {"text": "From: cs89ssg@brunel.ac.uk (Sunil Gupta)\nSubject: Re: MESSAGE: for cgcad@bart.inescn.pt\nOrganization: Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\nLines: 7\n\n\nSunil Gupta (cs89ssg@brunel.ac.uk) wrote:\n: I cant get through to the author of rtrace.

Did I misunderstand?\n\nReading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in\nthe world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\n\nLet's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\nto the Septuagint.\n\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\nhave little theological import.\n\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\nseptuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\nmaterial, but so far this hasn't happened.\n\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\nOT, unlike for the NT.\n-- \nC.
