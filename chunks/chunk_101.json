Gill\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\n\nDate: 93/5/16\n\n\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\n--------------------------------------\n\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded\nimages from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\n(or the lack of it).\n\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\n--------------------------------------\n\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\nsomething like this:\n\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\n\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\n\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\n\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\n\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\nimages with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\n\nWhose fault is all this ?\n-----------------------\n\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\nout there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is\nthat most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or\ndon't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\ngamma's.\n\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\n\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\n\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\nin the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\nto give a tint to the image. ]\n\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\nbit.)\n\nIf your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\nwill be above the center.\n\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\naround 2.2 \n\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\n-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\n\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\nto some degree or other.\n\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\n\nIf your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\n\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\nimages at the popular level.\n\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\n\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).\n\n###########################################################################\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: pat@rwing.UUCP (Pat Myrto)\nSubject: Re: Once tapped, your code is no good any more.\nArticle-I.D.: rwing.2089\nDistribution: na\nOrganization: Totally Unorganized\nLines: 45\n\nIn article <1993Apr19.193528.5655@cs.ucla.edu> geoff@ficus.cs.ucla.edu (Geoffrey Kuenning) writes:\n>In article <2073@rwing.UUCP> pat@rwing.UUCP (Pat Myrto) writes:\n>\n>> fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.

I also stated in another\npost I don't give a damn what administration does it, I still find it\ntotally unacceptable, and whoever impliments it or rams it down our throats\nought to be run out of office.\n\nAlso, Bush was not trying to deprive us of our Second Amendment rights.\nClinton is BUSTING HIS BUTT in that regard.  That reveals a total difference\nin philosophy.  Clinton appears to support the idea of TOTAL people\ncontrol.  Eavesdropping whenever they feel like it, no real security\nfor the common person, and no ability to defend oneself against illegal\nattack, from whatever source.  \"Trust us, we will protect (and control)\nyou... if we don't find it inconvenient...\"\n\nClinton has also shown his utter contempt for public disclosure and\naccountability, as well.  He had plenty of time to change the policy.\n\nHE DIDN'T.  HE EXPANDED ON IT.\n\nI bet had Bush been in office, you would be in there howling louder\nthan I.\n\n-- \npat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA\n         If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat\nWISDOM: \"Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,\n         and I am not sure about the former.\"              - Albert Einstien\n"}, {"text": "From: livesey@solntze.wpd.sgi.com (Jon Livesey)\nSubject: Re: Societally acceptable behavior\nOrganization: sgi\nLines: 30\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: solntze.wpd.sgi.com\n\nIn article <C5ws1s.7ns@news.cso.uiuc.edu>, cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb) writes:\n|> In <1r4ioh$44t@fido.asd.sgi.com> livesey@solntze.wpd.sgi.com (Jon Livesey) \n|> writes:\n|> > |>In article <C5qGM3.DL8@news.cso.uiuc.edu>, cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike \n>|> Cobb) writes:\n|> >|> \n|> >|> This doesn't seem right.

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about\nprospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of\nFame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked \nat players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they\nwere 24, and noticed some interesting things. \n\n  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in\nthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented the\nmajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that\nthey actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers\nlasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  \nfound that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and\nproduced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first\ngroup outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away\nthe second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. \n\n  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory. \n\n  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight. \n \n-- \nDave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 \nkirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!\n\"Not to beat a dead horse, but it's been a couple o' weeks .. this \n disappoints me..punishments..discharges..jackhammering..\" - Stephen Lawrence \n"}, {"text": "From: steve-b@access.digex.com (Steve Brinich)\nSubject: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications, Greenbelt, MD USA\nLines: 10\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\n  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the\nFUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.\n  If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole\ndebate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the\nfield say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the\nFeds.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\n----------------------------------------------------\n      |                            | Exit\n      |                            | 130B\n      |                            |\n   \n"}, {"text": "From: KCSCHIE@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu\nSubject: WANTED: Playboy campus girls issues\nOrganization: Illinois State University\nLines: 5\n\nI'm looking to buy the annual Playboy magazine  issue featuring\ngirls from colleges around the US.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\n\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\n\nShaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.\nI've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\n\n- How exactly did they do this?\n\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\nNazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\nto be a Turkish Jew.\n\n- How so?\n\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\nYou  can't do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\n\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\nParis,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\nconsuls took place.\n\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\nconsuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\n\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\n\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\n\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\ngovernments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of\nthe Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\n\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\nfrom Nazi persecution.\n\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\ncouldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\nthat  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\n\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\nsend money and food out of the country.\n\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\nliving in Israel.\n\nYes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\n\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\n\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\n\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\n\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\ncould see the documents.\n\n- What languages are used in the documents?\n\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\n\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\nsomeday will make the effort.\n\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?\n\nRight. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\n\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\n\nI'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\nall sorts of political movements.\n\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\nUniversity of  Istanbul.

I'm not sure if you meant to imply that or not, but I just thought\n># I'd bring that up.\n\n>Hitler became Chancellor because people voted for his political\n>party.  That's not a huge difference in a parliamentary system.\n\nYour statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\nGerman voters.\n\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\nChancellor.\n\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\n\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\nbegun to decline.\n\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\nparties to work together.\n\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\n\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\n\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But\nthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him\n*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to\ntake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties\n(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.\nHitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see\nthe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.\n\n-----\nEric Smith\nerics@netcom.com\nerics@infoserv.com\nCI$: 70262,3610\n\n"}, {"text": "From: mark.whalley@uk.co.gec-mrc (Mark Whalley)\nSubject: Windows Backgrounds\nReply-To: mark.whalley@uk.co.gec-mrc (Mark Whalley)\nOrganization: GEC-Marconi Research Centre, Great Baddow, Essex\nLines: 21\n\nHelp, I'm bored with the current Windows backgrounds we have here and am \nlooking for some nifty pictures to use instead.

I've got a problem that \nI need as many people's help from as possible.\n\nBefore I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell\nyou that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy\nmeets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...\n\nOK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family\nand I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the\nstreet, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...\nher name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have\nbeen writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about\n2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. \n\nBy the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.\n\nOK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming\nback to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I\ndrove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent\nthe whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though\nwe had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being\nin person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.\n(She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could\nask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to \nmention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but\nshe had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family\nis one of those families who goes to church but that is about the\nextent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she\nknows I am a Christian. \n\nWell, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such\na thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid\nyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.\n\nIn out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding\ndates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).\nShe has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended\nup leaving school....Now we are at the present...\n\nLet me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....\n\n\n\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not\ngoing to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College\njust wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and\nthat just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested\nme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was\ninterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with \nkids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents\ncould tell.\n\n\"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now\nI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room\nM-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and \nit's great experience.\n\n\"As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very\nnear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to\nstudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of\nyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be\nto Kansas.\n\n\"Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district \nmanager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for\nabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll \nbasically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to \nchose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\nWhat do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.\n\n\"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay\nand any thye of management experience would look good on an application\nor resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good\nbenefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time\nservice, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng\nfor me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up \npaying out of state tuition wherever I go.\n\n\"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I \nrespect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for \nsoooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really \ngood. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want\nto do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.\nI don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female\nis too bad. \n\n\"Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,\nMARRY ME...\n\n\"You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously\n(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the\nhome life later.\"\n\n***********\n\nOK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you\nthink she meant about the marraige thing?? \n\nI dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her\nletter!!! I don't know what to think??\n\nSince she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a \nBass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???\n\nI always pick on those people who graduate from high school and\nget married....but what does she mean??? \n\nI've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that \nI don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that\nmost college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the\nGreeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here\nshe says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!\n\nMaybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am\nso attracted to paying some real attention to me.\n\nI mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm\nonly 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through\nclasses..\n\nI have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..\nsaying, \"God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..\"\n\nCould this be my sign???\n\nI would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes \nit worse..\n\nShould I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even like\nto talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.\n\nI mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very\naverage guy like me??\n\nI'm really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.\n\nThanx \n\nChris\n\n[I have a feeling that it might be more appropriate to talk with\nChris directly via email.  --clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: raman@cs.cornell.edu (T.

Wijers)\nSubject: Re: Gamma Ray Bursters. WHere are they.\nOriginator: news@nimaster\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.princeton.edu\nOrganization: Princeton University\nLines: 51\n\n\nI feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\nBATSE press releases.\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \n     \"if you smack two neutron\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\n      be wrong.\"\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\nburst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \nso-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\nin the failed supernova scenario.\n\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\nit *must* be so-and-so.\n\nRalph Wijers\n\n"}, {"text": "From: WHMurray@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL\nSubject: Licensing...\nOrganization: Yale CS Mail/News Gateway\nLines: 24\n\n\n>This actually supports Bill's speculation - IF there is a backdoor in\n>RSAREF and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA, then it is more\n>than natural that they will welcome ANY public-key implementation that\n>uses RSAREF and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY\n>implementation that doesn't.\n\nMy speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF.

I upgraded my motherboard last fall.

It's in the\nBIOS, and if software had told me \"this isn't the machine you installed me\non\" I would never have used that software again.  Really bad idea.\n\n> I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's \n> conscience should do that.\n\n\tThis is silly.  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let\nthem do an install than to backup your copy already on disk, and then give\nthem that.  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone.\n\n> You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable\n> the quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!

And there is very\nlittle that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing.  Using PKLITE or\nsome similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .EXE\nwere tagged as uncompressable.\n\n> What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus\n> a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup\n> \"REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip\" and disables the above.\n\n\tThis is by far the best idea you presented in your post.

Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both\nthe Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't \nneed the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to \nmake it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a \nman well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was\nburied begs the question.\n\nNow, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on\nthis a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a \ndeliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm\nnot talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth, \nbut unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about\ndying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to\nbe a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the \nbody seems rather lightweight to me.\n\nAs for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over \nthe body of Jesus?
