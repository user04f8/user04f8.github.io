fall of man\n>occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual\n>world.  \n\nThis was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\nas true.\n\n>The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\n>an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to consign Adam\n>or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.\n\nI don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\nas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation\nvia faith and nothing else.\n\n>It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\n>relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\n>extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. \n\nI understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\nconsciousness.  \n\n>It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\n>were lost. \n\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \n>\n>It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\n>people's ideas of life after death.\n\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply\nhave to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive. \nEither that or countless trips to the oriental museum.\n>\n>Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \"the turning point of\n>time\" a new light entered into the world.

Our new\n>vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\n>something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\n>much more as well.\n\n\nCouldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is\nclearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring\nto.\n\n>(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\n>Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\n>views on this subject).\n\n>The way you refer to it as \"doctrine\" puts a modern intellectual coloring\n>on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\n>concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\n>teachings today can be received.\n\nNo, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.\n\n>\n>I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\n>simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\n>on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\n>and experience? \n\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I\nthink, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it. \nLook at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very\ninteresting study.\n\n >The similarity in the midst of great variety of\n>expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately\n>after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.\n\nYes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \"mystery\" religions\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\ntoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in\nEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \"husband son.\")\n\n>On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\n>that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\n>human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\n>created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\n>dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\n>today.\n\nNo, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the\nchurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their\nworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\nthe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's \"Egyptians.\"  He really\ndoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they \"pilfered\" from the\nEgyptians. \n\n> He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\n>time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\n>eternal spiritual being had grown dim.\n\nI'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.  Its just that\n\"there is nothing new under the sun.\"\n\n\n>Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\n>irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\n>which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\n>single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\n>reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\n>terms that did not try to spell it out.\n\nEach age has its own focus of theology.  The early church struggled with the\nTrinitarian formulation.  The reformation dealt with authority.  Today,\neschatology has had much study.  The early creeds do not spell these things out\nin detail because, 1) they weren't the topic of concern, 2) there was\ninsufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn't have the exegetical tools that\nwe have today.  Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  One\nage has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is\ngiven growth.  It would be natural for the end of times to have the garden\nappropriate for the growth of eschatology, wouldn't it?\n>\ntangents, never ending tangents,\nRex\n"}, {"text": "From: seema@madvlsi.columbia.edu (Seema Varma)\nSubject: Luser!\nOrganization: Columbia University\nX-Posted-From: china.madvlsi.columbia.edu\nNNTP-Posting-Host: sol.ctr.columbia.edu\nLines: 13\n\nHi,\n\tI am looking for a very high speed \nD/A converter (at least 8bits and 150MHz) for\na research application.

The course included\ncults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external\nreading too).\n\nWilliam Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of\n\"evil\" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what\nwould motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,\nand by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think\nthe books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced\n..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I\nthink they're onto something.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\tHow cult psychology works...\n\t[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]\n\nSo long as Koresh could \"own\" his people, he made sure they didn't\nbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.\nOtherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians\nrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived\nonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.\nAbsolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they\nbelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even\nthe Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left\nhim, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces\nof the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)\ncouldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die\ntoo, like the folks in Jonestown.\n\nFor a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife\n(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then\nthemselves.  That's the consequence of shattered \"cultism.\"  It really\ndoes happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such\ncases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no\nmatter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]\n\n...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]\n\nI agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good\n(?)  reasons for news blackouts.\n\n>\tThe only fact available is that had the FBI not acted  \n>\tyesterday, those people would be alive today.\n\n ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh\nmade sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.\nHence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He\nheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing\nwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!\n\nLook at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,\nat the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once\nJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his\nentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd\nbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought\nup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are\ntapes...  The \"logic\" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it\nwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people\nwho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by\nTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the\nsame with the Branch Davidians.\n(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER\nWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)\n\n...\nThe only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate\nreports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying\nfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the\noff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...\n\nSo, the only way the BATF/FBI could \"save\" those people, and future\ncults, is by ignoring such signs.\n\nI suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him\ninto letting them go, or somehow influencing \"his\" people to abandon\nhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.\n... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that\nwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe\nthey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.

It's more likely that the Moon will never\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\nmaterials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \nand it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat \nsink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor \nactivity in the global scope of things.\n\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\n\nWe don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\ncenturies, if not much longer.\n\nLuna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little\nultimate profit either.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n"}, {"text": "From: guykuo@carson.u.washington.edu (Guy Kuo)\nSubject: Re: Centris 610 clock adjustment?\nArticle-I.D.: shelley.1r7rc4INNmu2\nDistribution: usa\nOrganization: University of Washington\nLines: 2\nNNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu\n\nThe article was probably referring to changing the clock oscillator in a manner similar to that done on Quadra 700's and IIsi's.

I am quite comfortable in a\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\nare not shared by everyone.\n\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want \nthem attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\nis Not there.\n\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\n\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to \nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\nministers.\n\nIn Christ,\nKershner\n-- \nKershner Wyatt\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com\n\nMy opinions are my own and aren't necessarily my employer's.\n"}, {"text": "From: jake@bony1.bony.com (Jake Livni)\nSubject: Re: Final Solution for Gaza ?\nOrganization: The Department of Redundancy Department\nLines: 18\n\nIn article <1483500364@igc.apc.org> Center for Policy Research <cpr@igc.apc.org> writes:\n>\n>Dear folks,\n>\n>I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.\n\nDear Elias, \n\nI counted at least 4 such answers in public (plus whatever private\nemail replies you may have received), yet you refuse to accept\nanything.

OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one\nthrough.\n\n>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?\n\n>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\n>designed for that.\n\nAs I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm.

You have not proposed any workable alternatives.\n\n>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; \n\nSpeak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow\nreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made\nto the 8 bit image palette.\n\nPerhaps that is why you yused the singular?\n\n>say,\n>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\n>expected that the image still is the same. \n\nLook, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\ncontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\nimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\n\n>So, XV were designed\n>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the\n>program work -- design error.\n\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\n\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\n\n>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\n>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\n>major change to the original design.\n\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So \nfar, you have not done so.\n\n>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\n>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\n\nArgh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it\nif it is so easy.\n\nOr alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.\n\n>Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\n>'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\n>up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\n>even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\n>(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\n\nI think this is a bit of an exageration.\n\nWhat you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in\nthe states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up.

What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the\nsystem of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?\n\nThe second section shows the sequence of events.\nThe law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the\nline with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope\nwith digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are\ntalking analogue telephony here).\nWhat next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?\nIs it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?\nI thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some\nintermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course\nin data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the\ndigital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the\nsame problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not\nbe at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later\nit would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units\n(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.\n\nHow tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed\nfor use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone\nline quality may well be poor.

Find someone who is making a difference,\nsomeone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times\nand has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask \nthe Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the \nwoman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful\nbusiness woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound\nbaby. They won't all be Christians, or even what you might\ncall religious, but there will be something in common.\n\nGod is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what is\nin those people's hearts. It doesn't matter if you can't give\nintellectual assent to any description you've heard, they're\nall wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart \nis a step in the right direction. Follow that instead.\nThen come back and read the Bible and you'll see that same\nthing described there.\n\n> > If nothing else makes sense, hang on to that idea, that God is love.\n> \n> I would say something similar, but in reverse order: love\n>      is god.\n\nGood, I guess we only have to work on your grammar. 8-)\n\nChris Mussack\n"}, {"text": "From: davewood@bruno.cs.colorado.edu (David Rex Wood)\nSubject: Calling a library which creates widgets (multiple times)\nNntp-Posting-Host: bruno.cs.colorado.edu\nOrganization: University of Colorado, Boulder\nLines: 91\n\nA few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set\nup an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should\nnever be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having\nsome problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models\nmy real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable\nfrom any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is\ncalled, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the\nold stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below,\nmain() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents\nthe interface to the library function.\n\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\n#include <Xm/PushB.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top)\n{\n        Widget topone = top;\t\t// in real prog, these are member vars\n        XtAppContext theapp = app;\t// of a class\n        int junk = 0;\n        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,\n                                        NULL);\n\n        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(\"blaaa\", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,\n                        topone,\n                        XmNheight, 50,\n                        XmNwidth, 50,\n                        NULL);\n\n        XtRealizeWidget(topone);\n        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)\t// real prog returns when \"Exit\" button clicked\n        {\n                XEvent event;\n                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);\n                XtDispatchEvent(&event);\n        }\n        XtDestroyWidget(box);\n        XtCloseDisplay(dis);\n}\n\n// SetItUp - should be called once only\nvoid SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top)\n{\n        int junk = 0;\n        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, \"test\", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,\n                NULL, NULL, 0);\n}\n\n// doit - some library function callable from the outside\nvoid doit()\n{\n        static XtAppContext app;\t// use these every time called\n        static Widget top;\n\n        static int setup = 0;\n\n        if (!setup)\n        {\n                SetItUp(&app, &top);\n                setup = 1;\n        }\n        bla(app, top);\n}\n\n// main - program which links to my library\nmain()\n{\n        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)\n        {\n                doit();\n                printf(\"sleeping...\\n\");//widget still on screen at this point\n                sleep(5);\n        }\n}\n\n\nThe problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.\n(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the \"sleep\" in the main prog,\ndespite the XtDestroyWidget call).\n\nAnyone see something I'm missing?\n\nThanks very much.\n\n(Please respond via email)\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}, {"text": "From: fbaker12@jade.tufts.edu (Frederick A.

Last year, the SUG 1991 disk\ncontained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,\nalmost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net\npostings, priced at only $250.\n\nOur aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be\nproduced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added\nas possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk\nset, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second\navailable later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other\nuseful material not found on previous disks.\n\nThe SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains\na lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great\nservice to make it available right away to our members (and this\npricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per\ndisk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a\nSUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live\nwithin the US or $55 outside.\n\nThe SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used\nby PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a\ntotal of 543MB of material, including:\n\nX11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after\nthe initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0\ndistribution are included (109MB of material).

It was just much less noticeable.\n  \n  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It\n  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the \n  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed\n  a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.\n  So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer\n  one.\n  \n>---\n>Sean Eckton\n>Computer Support Representative\n>College of Fine Arts and Communications\n\n>D-406 HFAC\n>Brigham Young University\n>Provo, UT  84602\n>(801)378-3292\n\n>hfac_csr@byu.edu\n>ecktons@ucs.byu.edu\n-- \nsignoff\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRuss Lister  rlister@cti.com  -or-  {well connected systen}!uunet!cti1!rlister \nComprehensive Technologies Int'l Inc., Arlington, VA\n==============================================================================\n"}, {"text": "From: lineber@lonestar.utsa.edu (Jerry M.

Note, though, that\nyou won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it\nmay be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.\n\nThe things are easy to dismantle.  The key piece of information is that\nwhen you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the\nfilm cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when\nthe camera is made.  So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's\nstandard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.\n\nAll the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables\nis rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,\nand throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in\nanother.  If you take it apart yourself, you get an AA alkaline battery\n(still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and\npieces from the camera.\n\nI expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really\ndetermined.\n-- \nSVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\nbetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"}, {"text": "From: hallam@dscomsa.desy.de (Phill Hallam-Baker)\nSubject: Re: Once tapped, your code is no good any more.\nLines: 63\nReply-To: hallam@zeus02.desy.de\nOrganization: Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Experiment ZEUS bei HERA\nDistribution: na\n\n\nIn article <1993Apr18.022011.15502@ringer.cs.utsa.edu>, whughes@lonestar.utsa.edu (William W.

If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then\n>JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?\n\nThis is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understood\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\nat the same time, he is God's son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\nhe really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\nthen it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's \nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\ncase, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\nisn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\nincarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \n\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\nThe fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\n \n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\ngroup, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense,\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\nBirth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn't\nimply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material.\n\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\na part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth.\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn't\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Son\nwho was incarnated.\n\n--clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: csundh30@ursa.calvin.edu (Charles Sundheim)\nSubject: Looking for MOVIES w/ BIKES\nSummary: Bike movies\nKeywords: movies\nNntp-Posting-Host: ursa\nOrganization: Calvin College\nLines: 21\n\nFolks,\n\nI am assembling info for a Film Criticism class final project.\n\nEssentially I need any/all movies that use motos in any substantial\ncapacity (IE; Fallen Angles, T2, H-D & the Marlboro Man,\nRaising Arizona, etc).  \nAny help you fellow r.m'ers could give me would be much `preciated.\n(BTW, a summary of bike(s) or plot is helpful but not necessary)\n\nThanx\n\n-Erc.\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nC Eric Sundheim        csundh30@ursa.Calvin.edu\nGrandRapids, MI, USA\n`90 Hondo VFR750f\nDoD# 1138\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}, {"text": "From: gtoal@gtoal.com (Graham Toal)\nSubject: Re: Off the shelf cheap DES keyseach machine (Was: Re: Corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip)\nLines: 9\n\n\t\tI think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines\n\tare known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart\n\thardware?)\n\nAssume the ton of smart hardware.
