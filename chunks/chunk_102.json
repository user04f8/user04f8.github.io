If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)\n\nHere is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the\npathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story\nbut would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the\npotential pitfalls of \"upgrading\" to DOS 6 that I have been able to\nnotice after only about a week of playing around with it.\n\nMy envorinment\n==============\n\nTI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk\nSystem BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments\nCL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel\nAdvance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments\nSmart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-\nWindows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs\n\nAfter \"updgrading\" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things\nbecame so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In the\nprocess of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.\n\n\nDisk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive\n==================================================\n\nWhile most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain\napplications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is\nthat commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to\nconsider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)\nand decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).\n\nThe Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from\nfactory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when \"upgraded\" to\nDOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of\nmore than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew\nthat DS compression must cost something.\n\nSpecifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually\n*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than\nI/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings\nin I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large\nrandom writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.\n\nWhile the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or\nsequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on\nWinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.\n\nThe tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv\non, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective\nstatements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or\neven that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and\nslow disk I/O'.\n\nThis explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why\n'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.\n\n\nDouble Space and Windows\n========================\n\nDBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you\nwanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that\nmatter even check on its usage -- try \"fasthelp dblspace\" in a dos box\nwithin windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you\nget.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.\n\nYes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to\nfile manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed\nfloppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed\nfloppy if you dont know how to.)\n\n\nDOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM\n==============================================\n\nDefragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited\npatiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.\nThis confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take\nno more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)\nbut it took 12 minutes.\n\nI discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran\nfaster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this\nhad to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)\nmodule which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,\nand it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After\ndisabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.\n\n\nMicrosft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots\n====================================================================\n\nIn the readme.txt file, you can find the the following\n\n\tRunning Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers\n\t----------------------------------------------------------------\n\tTo avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup\n\tfor Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in\n\tyour CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you\n\trun Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.\n\nIf you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it\nmeans \"disable all power saving features of your notebook\".  Why would\nanyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only\ndoes TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the\nreadme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what\nelse) are crippled by the TI's power saver.\n\nIt is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If\nthere indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI\nprogrammers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have\nto guess as to who are the idiots.\n\nBy the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE\nin DOS6, when you check the status, it says:\n\n\tPower Management Status\n\t-----------------------\n\tSetting =  ADV: MAX\n\tCPU: idle 60% of time.\n\nThis figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook\nwhen I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in\niconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all\nfor itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is\nsuch an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating\nsystem or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%\nidle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type\nof package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'\nexample of our times!\n\n\nMicrosoft programmers do not know batch programming\n===================================================\n\nI like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of\naddpath statements like this:\n\n\tset PATH=C:\\DOS\n\t...\n\tset PATH=C:\\ETC\\BIN;%PATH%;C:\\BIN\n\t...\n\tset PATH=C:\\ETC\\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\\WINDOWS\n\t...\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\BCC\\BIN\n\t...\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\n\nEven though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old\none (i.e. c:\\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every\npath statement, and prepends C:\\DOS to its value.  As a result, my\nresultant path has so many DOS's.\n\nIf the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add\nthe new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement\ncontaing the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.\n(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a\ndirectory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)\n\nInstead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)\ndecided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and\nprepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it\nwould not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.\n\nI started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft\nrepresentative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he\nspecifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the\ninformation to him as he did not have access to internet.\n\nNow that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement\nwith %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement\nshould not be touched for any reason?\n\nAs another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to\nunderstand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:\n\n\tset MOUSE=C:\\ETC\\MOUSE\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\n\tloadhigh %MOUSE%\\MOUSE.COM\n\nGuess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with\n\n\tLH ... C:\\ETC\\MOUSE\\MOUSE.COM\n\nWhy is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its\nparameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.\n\n\nDOS 6 Software Quality\n======================\n\nDOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,\nyou end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the\ncommands that come with it.\n\nI am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to\nuse all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont\nwithin a week, I will post how you can create this \"ghost\" file.\n\nSurely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a\nparticular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)\nprogrammers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find\nit -- that is what I was told how Microsoft \"tests the quality\" of\ntheir products.\n\nI think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to \"test quality\"\nwhen it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but\ncan only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any\nform of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs\nthat will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond\nrepair!\n\nAlso, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk\nis fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the\ndefragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated\nwhen I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive\ndefragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and\nwith no new file creation since.\n\nMicrosft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you\nadmit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we\nshould watch out for if we have already used DS.\n\nJaya\n\n--\nDr. Jayasooriah  CSE, CS&E, UNSW | Sign in a Paris hotel:                    \nP.O.

Here's my question:\n\nCONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the\n         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my\n         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it\n         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone\n         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that\n         I type \"telnet uicvm\" or \"tn3270 uicvm\" (either will work) at the DOS\n         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then\n         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon\n         screen. \"TELNET\" and \"TN3270\" are the names of batch files in my SLIP\n         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the\n         session.\n\nPROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I\n         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I\n         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that\n         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me\n         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to\n         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)\n         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP\n         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP\n         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-\n         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when\n         that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often\n         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center\n         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to\n         them with more questions.\n\nQUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows\n         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too\n         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that\n         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost\n         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:\n\n         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1\n         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation\n         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the\n            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp\n            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about\n            that.\n\n         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true\n         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under\n         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently\n         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet\n         session and other applications.\n\nAny information received is appreciated.\n\nPankaj Saxena\nu09416@uicvm.uic.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: chapman@cs.sfu.ca (John Chapman)\nSubject: TIFF file viewer needed\nOrganization: CSS, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada\nLines: 13\n\nHello - I am in need of a file viewer for 24 bit TIFF images, to run under\n        windows (3.1 if it matters); alternatively a package to run an\n        X-server on top of windows would do very well.

Does\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\nsupporter?\n\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\nof their rhetoric. \n\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\n\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\n\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\nof a system that would commit genocide. \n\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\n\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\n\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\n\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \naffect the system.\n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker\nPhill Hallam-Baker\n"}, {"text": "From: NURDEN1@elaine.ee.und.ac.za (Dale Nurden)\nSubject: Re: Bios passwords\nOrganization: Elec.

This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

The Mariners\nhad the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the\nfielder catches.

(I know, I can think of several \"If the Mariners stole third\nand second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a\ngrounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and\nthird, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and\nmaybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...\nscenarios, too.
