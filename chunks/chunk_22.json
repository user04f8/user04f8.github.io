As\nI've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of \neliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers,\nbarbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian\nagenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of\nallowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without\nregulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be \nfree to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.  \n(As some/many libertarians would argue.)  \n\nOn a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation\nis obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call\nfor this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any\nkind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of \ndifficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic, \nto say the least.\n\nI have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education, \nnational defense or local police that suggests a \"free market\" can provide\na more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives\nthan is provided through \"statist\" approaches.   With some notable\nexceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile \nanalysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.  \n\njsh\n--\nSteve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \n\"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\n the bulls**t.\" - R.

But to suggest that a\n*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is \ntaking things much too far.

The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\n>\n>In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things.\n>There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ?\n>I don't know.\n\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\nno more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think\nit's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,\nbut God's grace covers her.

About the only tangible thing we can look at is\nopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.\nCatchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. \n\n  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big\nbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that\nthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard\nplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak \ndefensively if Blauser plays.

Brown\nSecretary\nDepartment of Commerce\n14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW\nWashington, DC 20236\n\nDear Secretary Brown:\n\n   As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy \nand security of telecommunications transmissions and data in \na networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the \nAdministration's endorsement of an electronic encryption \nstandard, based upon \"clipper chip\" technology, have raised a \nnumber of related issues.  The international competitiveness \nof U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is \na key factor that the government should consider when \naddressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the \nnation moves forward in developing the national \ncommunications and information infrastructure, security of \ntelecommunications transmissions and network data will be an \nincreasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of \nusers.\n\n   The \"hacker\" community can compromise the integrity of \ntelecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the \nnetwork.  The people and businesses that use the nation's \ntelecommunications network and the personal computers linked \nthrough it increasingly are demanding that information be \nprotected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.\n\n   I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean \nthat to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies \nwould be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. \ngovernment customers, and another for private, commercial \nusers who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may \ninadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping \nto serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis \nof this issue, please respond to the following questions:\n\n1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the \nAdministration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST \nor the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the \nnature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any \nplans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how \nsuch experts will be chosen.\n\n2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the \nholders of the \"keys\" to decrypt scrambled data?  What \nprocedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to \ndesignate such key holders?\n\n3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the \nAdministration contain a \"trap door\" or \"back door,\" which \ncould allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to \ncrack the code?\n\n4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used \nfor communications will require new techniques and additional \nequipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid \nadvancement of telecommunications technology?\n\n5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place \non the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to \nconsumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard \nin their equipment?\n\n6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the \ncompetitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the \n\"clipper chip\" technology on U.S. exports of computer and \ntelecommunications hardware and software products?\n\n   I would appreciate your response by no later than close-\nof-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any \nquestions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or \nKaren Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdward J.

And then in the\nexamples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even\nwhen only one league expanded.\n\nSo (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues\nbecause the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making \nevery team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up\nplayers that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.\n\nMake sense?\n"}, {"text": "From: wex@cs.ulowell.edu (Paul M.

I have attempted to gather as many case histories as\npossible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies\nprobably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that\nsuccess rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24\nmachines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.\nThis is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.\n\nThanks to all who contributed to this poll. \n\n\nIssues:\n\n\tSpeed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without\n\t\tadd on cards. All reported machines were able to use\n\t\t25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple\n\t\tNubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter\n\t\twas able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to\n\t\tachieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place\n\t\n\t\tAt speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and\n\t\thi density floppy disk problems have been reported.\n\t\t\n\t\tNote: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not\n\t\t\ttested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,\n\t\t\tthe 25 mhz operational machines may well work at\n\t\t\thigher speeds.\n\t\t\t\n\tDamage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was\n\t\trepaired and the machine is operational. One other\n\t\treported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator\n\t\tduring desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user\n\t\tputting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.\n\t\t\n\t\tNo reports of static discharge damage.\n\t\t\n\t\tNo reports of high speed operation causing damage.\n\t\t\n\t\tThen again, I also don't have any reports from users of\n\t\tdefective parachutes.\n\t\t\n\tAdd on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus\n\t\tAdapters. Several other add on boards have been used with\n\t\tsuccess. See case histories\n\t\t\n\tHeat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.\n\t\tThese were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some\n\t\tused epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab\n\t\tof cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a\n\t\tbolt through the hole in the motherboard.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nCase Histories:\t\n\nAll speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator).

But\nthe chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't\nbe submitted for discussion.\n   Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon\na special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for\nthe Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the \nobjective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the\nserious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the\nrepublic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,\nejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion\non these questions.\n   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,\nwhen it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.\n   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50\ndeputates (25 \"democrats\" and 25 \"partocrates\"). At that time \"democrats\" and\n\"partocrates\" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long \ntime and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,\nthe deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon\na session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out\nof the Parliament. --0--\n\n\nTHE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA\n\n    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement\nbetween Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign \nMinister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. \nThe group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of\nEconomics of Estonia.\n   The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku,\nthe delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the\nrepublic.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE\n\n   Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid\nAhmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS\ncommon economic zone.\n   Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a \ncommon tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. \nAccording to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for\nthe discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number\nof unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.\n   Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the\nbackground of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of\nthe Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic\nzone.--0--\n\n\nTHE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW\n\n     Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director\nof the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic\nalong with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to\nhold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. \nAccording to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.\n    As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent, \nprecise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other\nquestions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in\nMoscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling\nof industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.\n    When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end \nof May.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF\nMAY\n\n     Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia,\nTurkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the\npresident of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted\nthat the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.\n     \"Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by \ninsistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis\nof the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6\",- said\nGasimov.\n     The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just\nbegan to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be \ngiven as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.\n     As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by\nArmenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--\n\n\nTHE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\n\n   BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced\nthat the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers \ncondemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent\npeople is unjustified.\n    Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,\nprove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units\nand with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they\nserved.\n    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers\nas ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also \nunfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the\nlist of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.\n   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of\nthe Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the\nRussian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this\ntype of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--\n\n\nAZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE\nSIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan\nis considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six\naccused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives\nof the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation\nto Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will\nbe directed to Russian parliament.\n     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give\nRussian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the\ninvestigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have\ngiven rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation\nin the war against Azerbaijan.\n\n\nARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE \"KARABAKHS\" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of \nArmenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies\non the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the\nnewspaper \"Russky vestnik\" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.\n     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the \ndocuments of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of \"reunion\" of\nthe North Caucasus and \"Armenia proper\" at present, the front is appealing to \nthe UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the\nneed to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.\n     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to\ncarry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity \"identical to\nthose in Nagorno Karabakh\". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian\nnational-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of\nArmenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus \ninstructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.\n     Thus according to the newspaper \"Russky vestnik\", \"new Karabakhs\" are \nbeing planning on the North Caucasus. --O--\n\n\nSTATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of\nAzerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural\ncenters was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president\nElchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and\nculture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. \n     The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a\nlegal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership\nof Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all \nnationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.\n     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,\nHidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the \"undeclared\nwar\" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many \nproblems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic\ngroups. \n     For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of\nJustice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture \nand means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign\ndiplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of\nfree accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). \n     As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted\nto create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of\nAzerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, \nradiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the\neducational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national\nteaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences\nof Azerbaijan.--O-- \n\n\nMEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED\n\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State \nconcern \"Azerineft\", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies\n\"AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum\", \"Bi-Pi Exploration Operating\", \"Pennzoil\nCaspian\", \"Unocal Khazar Ltd.\", \"McDermott\" and Turkish oil corporation on\nmutual extracting of fields \"Azeri\", \"Chirag\" and \"Gyuneshli\" was signed. \nAccording to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common\nprogram of activity was created. \n     According to the president of \"Azerineft\", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation\nwill provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. \n     During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of\noil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of\nexploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the\nexploitation of these fields. \nThe memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical\nand political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas\nfields. --O--\n\n\nARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on \nsix Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,\nArmenian propaganda has become actively involved.\n     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin\nwith a request \"to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian\nsoldiers\". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings\non the case in Baku as \"a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia\".\n     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could\nbelieve the Yerevan agency \"Snark\", the Armenians in Karabakh presented\nan ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum\nis that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in\nKarabakh will be shot dead.\n     It is simple to explain such \"touching attitude of Armenians\" to\nthe six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed\nit will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused\nRussian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister\nof Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.\n     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its\nsaving of lives of \"innocent Russians\". --O--\n\n\nNEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of\nAzerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan\nfrom the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.\n     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,\nNyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from\nKafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were\ndestructions in the villages.\n     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,\nShynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of\nAzerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in\nprogress.\n     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of\nArmenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated\ninto the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two\nshepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a\nflock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--\n\n\n\"UNOCAL\" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the\nrepresentation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this\ncompany decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of\n50 houses for refugees.\n     At present, the American side suggested a village project for \nconsideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project\nis a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary\naccommodations and so on.\n     According to the program the construction and putting into\noperation of the village will be this year. --O--\n\n\nMANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE\n\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the\nnational currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian\nRuble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.\nTaking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with \nrespect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value\n10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is\nthe same at banks, state establishments and in trade.\n     According to the representatives of the business circles and\nexperts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles\nare bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial\noperations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics\nof the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen\narrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business \nwith Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much \nRubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--\n\n\nTHE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY\n\n    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, the\nexpert group, including representatives of the Parliament and \npresidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before\nthe Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new\nConstitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of\nthe country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the\npress-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.\n    Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and \nrepresentatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev\nand Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.\n    The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary\nelection law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill\ndidn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative\nvariant of the election law was put forward.\n   The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions\nwill examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all\nproposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--\n\n\nISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR \nCLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED\n\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the\nAzerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman\nof the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with\nthe conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant\nK. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the\nSupreme Court of Azerbaijan.\n   In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan\nMilly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme\nSoviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal\ncase. In his view, \"the conclusion of the commission could help in the \nobjective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems\nin the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the\nknowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime\".\n   In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,\nMilly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the\npermanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human\nrights and international relations are charged with the exploration of\nthis problem.--0--\n\n\nWILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?\n\n      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative\nto the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the \nTrilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with\nthe representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case\nthe peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.\n     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors\nof the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is\npaving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from\nthe peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and\nUS having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial\nUS departure from Transcaucasia.--0--\n\n\nFATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER\n\n   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,\nSabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of\noil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.\nAs it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-\nRAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian\nfields.\n   According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete\ntreaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and\nPENNZOIL will sign treaties.\n   Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645\nmillion ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton\non Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.\n   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to\nbring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net\neconomic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in\nthe defence of its interests at the international scene.\n   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement \"the May of\n1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its\nindependence and we have to stand these tests\".--0--\n\nTHE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN\n\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan\ninforms, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.\nThe appeal contains the call \"to display mercy, humanism and clemency \non the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed\nForces\".\n   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the\nparticipation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,\ndon't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce\nthe mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the\nRussian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.\n    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers'\nmothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the\npresident of Azerbaijan to \"save those guys\".\n   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers,\ntaking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only\nRussian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down\nlives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made\nanswerable.\n    Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers\nof Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--\n\n\nARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS\n\n     BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of\nAzerbaijan were killed during the \"Grad\" shelling of the villages of\nKolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of\nthe republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.\n     The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages of\nTovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire\nfrom the territory of Armenia. There are destructions. \n     The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated. \nOn May 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from the\nvillage of Ortakend.

The business cooperation between the two countries\ndevelops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil\nextraction equipment, communication and agriculture.\n  According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit of\nAzerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May\n23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will\nhelp, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch\noffices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude\ncontracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on\nbuilding in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the\nentire communication system of Azerbaijan.\n   In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain\nwill have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.\n   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great\nBritain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of\nthe economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--\n\n           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \n             T U R A N    N E W S    A G E N C Y\n                     Baku - Azerbaijan      \n                Phone: (8922) 66-7977  66-7833\n                    Fax: (8922) 66-2009\n                   Telex: 142168 META SU\n           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n                  \nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'

A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance.

Why would He have created us if He did not love us \nenough to help us through this world?\n\n\tI also do trust my experiences to some extent.

You must\nchoose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to\nfollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with\nyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,\nwe have to accept your decision, although we always keep\nthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find out\nwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try\npraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians\nabout their experiences personally.

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\n\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\nThe first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\n\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\nto my use and flamage in general.\n\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\napplicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a\nflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your \nmotorcycle lean to the outside while turning.

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew\nmust learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The\nland in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same\nnew Jew who has \"learned\" to work it. Both aspects of the\ntwo-pronged concept of \"Hebrew labor\" have racist connotations. On\nthe one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical\nlabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other\nhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the\nArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.\n\nThe occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from\nthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and\nhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \"Hebrew labor\" to the\nhistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It\nhas blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to\nproblems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this\nconcept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the\nclosing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of\nEnvironment Minister Yossi Sarid, \"I have no tears for those who\nget rich off of cheap labor\". 2) to furnish an answer to the\nunemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for\nwages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.\n\nThe Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from\nthe far- East to replace native people, Palestinians, who work in\ntheir own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two\nethnical communities and ruling over them.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: egreen@east.sun.com (Ed Green - Pixel Cruncher)\nSubject: Re: Back Breaker, Near Hit!!\nOrganization: Sun Microsystems, RTP, NC\nLines: 22\nDistribution: world\nReply-To: egreen@east.sun.com\nNNTP-Posting-Host: laser.east.sun.com\n\nIn article 3tu@menudo.uh.edu, inde7wv@Rosie.UH.EDU () writes:\n>\n>I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you\n>really in actuality avoid such an incident?

But where did that choice come\nfrom?\n\nWe know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a\ntempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover,\ninvent, create, call the action what you will, something that God\nhad not given origin to?\n\nAlso, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will?\nWe make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me\nas being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like\nsalvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.\n\nAt least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly\ncoupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...\n\nStill, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had\nperfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an\nact that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to\nexist for the first time?\n-- \nLucio de Re (lucio@proxima.Alt.ZA) - tab stops at four.\n"}, {"text": "From: irvine@uxh.cso.uiuc.edu (Brent Irvine)\nSubject: Re: ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH - UPDATE\nDistribution: usa\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nLines: 17\n\nIn article <C5uHuo.Awq@usenet.ucs.indiana.edu> wwarf@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (Wayne J.

(Take a few\n>seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it's implications!!!)\n\nI have thought about the implications, and it is scary.  \n\nWe have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have \ndecided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the\nthrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is\nlegitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's\ndecision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can\nhave a more \"deep, committed relationship.\"\n\nMarriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life.\nLove is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.\n\nIs it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many \nyears who stayed home to care for the children because he\ncan't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful\nyoung blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to\nmake a renewed effort.  \n\nHold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His\nrelation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We\nlearn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and\nremain faithful through times of trial.\n\nMy spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed.\nIf it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!)\nthen perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual\nrelations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me\npermission to seek someone else to satisfy my \"needs.\"  \n\nThe idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple \"grows apart\"\nseems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning\nof marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint\nof compromise.  We have become so petty and small-minded that\nsome husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the\nwives lose weight!\n\nI praise the Lord for guiding me to marry my wife.  She married me\nanyway despite the possibility that I could have a terrible illness.\nAnd it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor, but\nhad I known I wouldn't have cared either.  And maybe I'll be in\na car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down.\nA married couple should deal with these situations with the help\nof the Lord, not divorce and run away from them.\n"}, {"text": "From: jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger)\nSubject: Re: Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\nOrganization: Boston University Physics Department\nLines: 60\n\nIn article <11847@vice.ICO.TEK.COM> bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine) writes:\n\n>In article <115670@bu.edu> jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger) writes:\n\n>>In article <11826@vice.ICO.TEK.COM> bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine) writes:\n\n>>I am refuting nothing but simply telling you what I see, which is\n>>childish propaganda and nothing to be refuted.

(You could,\nregardless of the state of the law, but there are some paragraphs which\nsuggest you would be violating the law.)\n\nIf it goes to court, the ITARs could be thrown out is incompatible with the\nFirst amendment; or the court could rule that \"software\" is \"technical\ndata\" not subject to the ITARs; or the court could rule that the\nphrase \"publicly available\" as defined in the ITARs would apply,\nmaking it only subject to requiring a general export license; or, you could\nbe prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage.

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means\nthird trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting\na 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at \n21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.\nUnless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or\na LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are\nwrong.\n\nBy the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad\nprohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as\nCalifornia, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally \nstopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, \nbut that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,\nwilling to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was\nterribly upset about this.\n\nI remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a\nclinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering\na bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice\ndoesn't have a grain of truth to it.\n-- \nClayton E.
