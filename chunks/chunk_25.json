So here it comes:\n\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\ndoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\n\n The result of this process is the following:\n  \n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.\n\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\n        there was room on the disk.\n\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\n\n\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\ntable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\nsort a directory listing?\n\n\nWith much thanks to the originator of this article.\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\n |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           |\n +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\n | \"Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           |\n |  Will this world ever get better, Can't we all just live together       |\n |  I don't wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              |\n |  I deserve to have a future...\"                                         |\n |                                     -The Good Girls    \"Future\"         |\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\n\n"}, {"text": "From: drlovemd@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu (Steve Liu)\nSubject: Scsi cable for sale\nOrganization: Homewood Academic Computing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md, USA\nLines: 22\nNNTP-Posting-Host: jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu\n\nI have a brand new, never used 12 inch mac to scsi cable for sale.

Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it\"\n\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\n\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the\n  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,\n  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass\n  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\n\nMicrostation Imager\n-------------------\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\n  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\n\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\n\n  Contact:\n  Rodney Hoinkes\n  Head of Design Applications\n  Centre for Landscape Research\n  University of Toronto\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Resource Listing\n-- \nNick (Nikolaos) Fotis         National Technical Univ. of Athens, Greece\nHOME: 16 Esperidon St.,       InterNet : nfotis@theseas.ntua.gr\n      Halandri, GR - 152 32   UUCP:    mcsun!ariadne!theseas!nfotis\n      Athens, GREECE          FAX: (+30 1) 77 84 578\n"}, {"text": "From: roby@chopin.udel.edu (Scott W Roby)\nSubject: Re: BATF/FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today! 4/19\nNntp-Posting-Host: chopin.udel.edu\nOrganization: University of Delaware\nLines: 51\n\nIn article <1r0qsrINNc61@clem.handheld.com> jmd@cube.handheld.com (Jim De Arras) writes:\n>In article <C5s0Ds.J54@news.udel.edu> roby@chopin.udel.edu (Scott W Roby)  \n>writes:\n>> I agree that they deserved a trial.

Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't have\nbeen retrofitted with \"magic fingers\" that converts from DTMF to pulse\ndialing.\n\nThomas\n--\nReal life:      Thomas T\u00f6rnblom           Email:  Thomas.Tornblom@Nexus.Comm.SE\nSnail mail:     Communicator Nexus AB     Phone:  +46 18 171814\n                Box 857                   Fax:    +46 18 696516\n                S - 751 08 Uppsala, Sweden\n"}, {"text": "From: keith@cco.caltech.edu (Keith Allan Schneider)\nSubject: Re: \"Cruel\" (was Re: <Political Atheists?)\nOrganization: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena\nLines: 26\nNNTP-Posting-Host: punisher.caltech.edu\n\nlivesey@solntze.wpd.sgi.com (Jon Livesey) writes:\n\n>>This whole thread started because of a discussion about whether\n>>or not the death penalty constituted cruel punishment, which is forbidden\n>>by the US Constitution.\n>Yes, but they didn't say what they meant by \"cruel\", which is why\n>a) you have the Supreme Court, and b) it makes no sense to refer\n>to the Constitution, which is quite silent on the meaning of the\n>word \"cruel\".\n\nThey spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution.

I've seen this sort \nof effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT \nconflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video \nhardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the \nQ950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to \n24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - \nit's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed \nthen.\n\nAnother thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like \nQuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.

Supposedly, only \"true\" clubbing\nis associated with disease. The problem is that the list of\ndiseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes\nboth congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of\nthese diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems\nleading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is\nvery reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the \ncongenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac\ncatheterization. \n\nThe cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to\nsome factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to\ndilate abnormally. \n\nClubbing is one of those things from an examination which is\na tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however,\nthe cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\n\n-km\n"}, {"text": "From: Alan.Olsen@p17.f40.n105.z1.fidonet.org (Alan Olsen)\nSubject: some thoughts on Christian books...\nLines: 32\n\nDN> I think I took on this 'liar, lunatic, or the real thing'\nDN> the last time.

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\n\nBut first let me say the following.\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\nI'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it's\n'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\nGod\".\n \nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\nWebster says:\n\nfaith \n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\nb  (1): fidelity to one's promises\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   (2): complete trust\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nof religious beliefs\nsyn see BELIEF\n\n\n\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be \nglad to.) \n\n\n\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \ndisagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \nthinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \nways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well  \nthought out discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> Cheers\n> \n> Simon\n> -- \n> Simon Clippingdale                simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk\n> Department of Computer Science    Tel (+44) 203 523296\n> University of Warwick             FAX (+44) 203 525714\n> Coventry CV4 7AL, U.K.\n\n--\nbob singleton\nbobs@thnext.mit.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: fist@iscp.bellcore.com (Richard Pierson)\nSubject: Moving On\nNntp-Posting-Host: foxtrot.iscp.bellcore.com\nOrganization: Bellcore\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 25\n\nWell, it's been fun.

Paul describes\n\"men with men working that which is unseemly\" to describe the acts.  \nSure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other\nsins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins\nsprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of \nman's not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their\nacts were shameless.\n\n>homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\n>other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\n>subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\n>in passing.\n\nIs everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament?\nScripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the\nSpirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also\nprotects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a\ntwo edged sword that cuts both ways.  \n\nI think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  \nIf the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, then\nthose who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  \nIf homosexuality were \"natural\" (whatever that means) wholesome, \nendorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded\nbiggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of\nit in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other\nsex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this\nlaw was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that\nthis was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty\ncrime!  \n\nIs every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at\nI Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a\nlaw not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's\nwife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in \nLeviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides\nthis one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting\nadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife.  \n\nNotice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned\nin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan \ncoustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact\ntaking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It was\njust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or\nnot.\n\n>One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\n>of questions we are trying to deal with.

It is unfair to take Paul's\n>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\n>judgements on these questions.\n\nOne of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\nis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can\nbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is\nhomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,\nlike lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of\nthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.\nGod is greater than all of it. \n\nAnother reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural\npower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many \npeople have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there\nmay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.\nThat is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not\nGod's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that\nuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to\nchange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other\nsin.\n\n>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\n>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.

Paul's dealings with\npastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order\nto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it\nwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.\nPaul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with\neating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty\nto eat meat in order to spare others.  \n\nBut Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to\ntough.  Paul wrote to \"make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts\nthereof.\"  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we\nshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.\n\nSuppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  \nSince others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approach\non pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should \nsacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a\nmember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual\n\"marriage\") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered \na more damaging sin.\n\n>For another example, Paul obviously\n>would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\n>remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\n>would rather see them married than in a state where they might be\n>tempted to fornication.\n\nYet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something\nthat God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.\n\n> Note that in the\n>creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\n>doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.\n\nActually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.\nAfter he fell he would have to toil over the ground.\n\n>The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\n>fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\n>psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\n>attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\n\nThat is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious\nposition to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our\nminds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just\nlike anyone else.\n\n>but I can well imagine Paul\n>preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\n>relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\n>suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such\n>relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love\n>with each other.\n\nI'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this \nconclusion.  It's like saying, \"How should I kill myself, with gun or\naresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to\nsleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,\nor all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?\nWould it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  \n\nIn all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher\nthe chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with \nphysical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all \nleads to spiritual death.\n\n>Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\n>relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\n>would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\n>argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\n\nThe issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the\nactual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that\nonly homosexuals of this century are capable of having \"loving\nrelationships?\"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual \"love.\"\n(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also,\nwhere do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly not\nexplicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.)\n\nLink Hudson.\n\n\n[I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  Our basic concepts of\nthe intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different.  As I indicated\nin the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and I still\nthink they are significant), it does seem clear that Paul considered\nthe homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  What you do with this fact\ndepends upon your basic approach to the Bible.  I'm afraid that\ncommunication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is even\nharder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent.  Since\nyou disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going to\ndisagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions.\nSometimes discussion is still useful.  I've seen some very interesting\nwork on Paul done by Jews.  Obviously they don't agree with him, but\nthey sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  But I don't\nsee much sign for hope here.  In talk.religion.misc there's an axiom\nthat by the time Hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensible\ndiscussion is gone.  On this subject, when sleeping with goats is\ninvoked, I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be\nworth pursuing.  --clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: gene@theporch.raider.net (Gene Wright)\nSubject: Why not give $1 billion to first year-long moon residents?\nOrganization: The MacInteresteds of Nashville, Tn.\nLines: 12\n\nWith the continuin talk about the \"End of the Space Age\" and complaints \nby government over the large cost, why not try something I read about \nthat might just work.\n\nAnnounce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation \nwho successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year. \nThen you'd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin \nto be developed.
