There are plenty of good \nreasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal \nhell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between \nGod and the Disloyal Opposition.

I've \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\n\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\nIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\nthey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\n\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\n                  ______\n3 G         /|   /      |\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \n          /  | /        |\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\n       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.\n1 G   /                 |\n                        |\n                        |\n0 G                     |\n\n             ^          ^\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\n\n\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\nout entirely.\n\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \nthat desired.\n\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\n\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\n    all at once?\n\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.

The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about \n60 degrees south latitude.\n\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that\naspect of the flight profile.\n\n-- \nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t    \"Find a way or make one.\"\n\t             -attributed to Hannibal\n"}, {"text": "From: bmoss@grinch.sim.es.com (Brent \"Spuzy\" Moss)\nSubject: Re: water in trunk of 89 Probe??\nNntp-Posting-Host: 130.187.200.5\nOrganization: Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp., Salt Lake City, UT\nLines: 4\n\nThe rubber drain plugs under my carpet in my mazda glc leaked\nlike the ones are doing under your spare in the Probe.\nI tooke them out and put some silicone sealant on them\nand put them back in.\n"}, {"text": "From: kevin@axon.usa (Kevin Vanhorn)\nSubject: Re: BATF/FBI Murders Almost Everyone in Waco Today! 4/19\nOrganization: /usr/users/kevin/.organization\nLines: 15\nNNTP-Posting-Host: axon.cs.byu.edu\nIn-reply-to: roby@chopin.udel.edu's message of Tue, 20 Apr 1993 05:53:07 GMT\n\n\nIn article <C5rpoJ.IJv@news.udel.edu> roby@chopin.udel.edu (Scott W Roby) writes:\n>\n> Two of the nine who escaped the compound said the fire was deliberately set \n> by cult members.\n\nCorrection: The *FBI* *says* that two of the nine who escaped said the fire\nwas deliberately set by cult members.

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\n\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\n\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\nwhat it all means later on). \n\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\n\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \n\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\ngraphics and how to use the package.\n\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\n\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I\nwill explain below.\n\n\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture,\nexcept the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are -\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,\nFour books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of\nParalpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five\nbooks of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of\nSolomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach],\nThe books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being\nJeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were\nformerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two\nbooks of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of\nthe New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the\nApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same\nto the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the\nApostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of\nJohn.\"\n\t-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)\n\n\tThis same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage\n(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which\ncouncil the same list was enumerated with the words \"Because we have\nrecieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the\nChurch.\"  Which ought to quiet those who assert \"in the name of Holy\nScripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was\nnever any doubt in the Church,\" as the Episcopal Church does in removing\nthe Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians\nhold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not\ncounted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The\nLutherans hold out similarly.)\n\tEarlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also\nbe found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it\ndivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.\n\n\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as\nconsisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the\nnumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also\nthat by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,\ncorresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks.\"\n\t-St. Hillary of Poitiers, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" prologue, 15 (365 AD)\n\n\"The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are ....

The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book;\nEcclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; of\nMaccabees, two books.\"\n\t-St. Damasus I, Pope, \"The Decree of Damsus,\" section 2 (382 AD)\n\n\tI would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the Church\nhas always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputed\nby various persons.  For if disputes involving the New Testament\ndeutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. Hebrews, James, 2\nPeter, 2&3 John, Jude, Revelation) in Protestant eyes, than neither\nshould it disqulaify the Old Testament books.  And I must point out that\nthe Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the founding\nof the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to a\ncanon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitian\nuse of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?  As early\nas 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the\nCanon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.  Protestants\napparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited by a decree\nof the Jews in the ordering of their (the Jews') faithless canon, and\nthat he could not use other people, like the Apostles, in drawing up the\ncanon.  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint, as some\n80% of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint, and\nnot the Hebrew.  And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon.\n"}, {"text": "From: \"Robert Knowles\" <p00261@psilink.com>\nSubject: Re: Islam And Scientific Predictions (was\nIn-Reply-To: <C5L1Fv.H9r@ra.nrl.navy.mil>\nNntp-Posting-Host: 127.0.0.1\nOrganization: Kupajava, East of Krakatoa\nX-Mailer: PSILink-DOS (3.3)\nLines: 35\n\n>DATE:   Fri, 16 Apr 1993 15:23:54 GMT\n>FROM:   Umar Khan <khan@itd.itd.nrl.navy.mil>\n>\n> His conclusion was that,\n>while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\n>say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\n>Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\n>the Traditions.

In general, you\nshould expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,\nthere is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain\nand discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another\nplayer. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That\ntwo hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of\nrespect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity.

All I can say is that I will not consume it.  \n\n[...]\n\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\n\n   [Reproduced without permission]\n\n\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\n\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\n\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\n\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\n\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\n\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\n\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\n\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\n\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\n\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\n\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\n\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\n\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\n\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\n\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\n\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\n\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\n\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\n\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\n\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\n\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\n\n\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\n\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\n\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\n\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\n\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\n\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\n\tafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm\n\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the\n\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\n\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association's\n\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\n\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\n\tclean bill of health.\n\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\n\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\n\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\n\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\n\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\n\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\n\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\n\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\n\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\n\tof selected foods omitted]\n\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\n\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\n\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\n\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\n\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\n\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\n\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\n\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\n\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\n\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\n\n\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)\n\n"}, {"text": "From: rogue@ccs.northeastern.edu (Free Radical)\nSubject: Re: Clipper considered harmful [Restated and amplified]\nNntp-Posting-Host: damon.ccs.northeastern.edu\nOrganization: College of CS, Northeastern U\nDistribution: inet\nLines: 43\n\nIn article <1rcboi$j4a@access.digex.net> steve-b@access.digex.com\n(Steve Brinich) writes: \n[...]\n>  FEDS: We need the keys to Joe Blow's phone.\n>\n>  ESCROW AGENT: Joe Blow?

On what\nra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call \"orthodox?\"\n\n     \"Orthodox\" is a compound word. It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, \n     right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to \n     refer to 'right teaching.' Right teaching is derived from letting God \n     speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths \n     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.\n\nra> Who is that \"holds that\" Luke meant what you said he meant?\n\n     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are\n     pertinent.\n\n     Luke 23:43 records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on\n     an adjacent cross: \"Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in\n     paradise.\" But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead\n     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until\n     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The\n     answer lies in the location of \"paradise\" when Jesus died.\n\n     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.\n\n     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and \n     Lazarus as \"Abraham's Bosom,\" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was\n     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus\n     \"Abraham's Bosom\" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed\n     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.\n\n     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of \n     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith\n     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven\n     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or\n     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with\n     the Father.\n\n     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the\n     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But\n     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene\n     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then\n     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise\n     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in\n     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: \"Ascending on high, He led captivity\n     captive; He gave gifts unto men.\" Verse 9 continues: \"But what does `He\n     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the\n     earth?\" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: \"He who descended is the same\n     as He who ascended above all the heavens.\" Presumably He led the whole\n     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of\n     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.\n\nra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is\nra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to\nra> \"look at the Bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who\nra> see Biblical things differently from you?\n\n     I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my 'personal \n     interpretation' is questioned, I usually give a reason.\n\n     As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where\n     there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. \n\n     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one \n     views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff \n     that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can \n     have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put \n     forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to \n     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views\n     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.\n\nra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really\nra> understands it?\n\n     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is \n     wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.  Simply \n     stating that there are other views is not a proof. Show it to me from \n     Scripture and then we can go on.\n\n\n=============================\nRobert Weiss\npsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: yatrou@INRS-Telecom.Uquebec.CA (Paul Yatrou)\nSubject: Re: Stop predicting\nOrganization: Bell-Northern Research Montreal, Canada.\nLines: 22\n\nIn <1993Apr16.060010.10012@ncsu.edu> cdkaupan@eos.ncsu.edu (CARL DAVID KAUPANG) writes:\n\n\n>It is really annoying to see all of these\n>predictions on the Net.

There you have a bunch of people who are\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\nis no way that will ever work.

What I completly disagree with is seperating that\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem.

Excerpt.\n\nEACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO*\n\n(* A reference to General Azri'el Nevo, Shamir's Military Secretary. \nIrrelevant to this excerpt.)\n\nBy Nahum Barne'a\n\n. . .\n\nIn mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [...]. \nA year and a half earlier, Khaled Sheikh Ali, 27, a member of the\nIslamic Jihad, died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison.  The\ntwo SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put\non trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and\nsentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was\nthe first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to\nprison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the\ndirector of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the\neffectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case\nwere [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.\n\nWhen they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators\nagreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed\nin charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the\ndirectors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter\nof the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture,\nbut also \"the culture of lies\", which Judge Landau had described in\nhis report of two years before, were still very much in existence. \nNothing had changed.\n\nThe report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among\nthem the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system\nand Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not\nknow.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with\nlow ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the\nexplanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered\nfrom his very high position to a less high position.\n\n. . .\n\n[\"The culture of lies\" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators'\npolicy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were\ntortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought\nto correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods --\nthus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those\nmethods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need to\nlie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking\nto the \"approved\" torture methods. -- Yigal]\n--\nYigal Arens\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\narens@isi.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: HART@uv2.EGlin.AF.MIL\nSubject: VXT2000 Windowing Terminal Help\nOrganization: The Internet\nLines: 63\nTo: \"xpert\" <xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu>\n\n                               E G L I N     A F B\n\nFrom:  DENNIS L.

The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key\nchildren (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access\nto guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in\nstudent gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between\n1988 and 1990.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.\n\nBrian Finnerty\n"}, {"text": "From: eczcaw@mips.nott.ac.uk (A.Wainwright)\nSubject: Re: New Study Out On Gay Percentage\nReply-To: eczcaw@mips.nott.ac.uk (A.Wainwright)\nOrganization: Nottingham University\nLines: 40\n\nIn article <F3ZB3B1w165w@codewks.nacjack.gen.nz>, system@codewks.nacjack.gen.nz (Wayne McDougall) writes:\n|> > brian@gab.unt.edu (Brian \"Drakula\" Stone) writes:\n|> > \n|> > >Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.

I've often\ncontemplated putting the boot in said dog's muzzle as I open the \nthrottle, but have never tried that. I figgure the impact would \nunballance me and I'd dump the bike. A bicycling technique I've\nemployed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog\nattacks. On one occasion I was attacked by a pack of four dogs at\nonce while peddaling up a steep hill. I lost my right sock, but no\nblood. I complained to the local Animal Control department (after\ncomplaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect) about the dogs;\nno more dogs, no more attacks. The telephone worked much better\nthan the tire pump.\n\nEric Bong DoD #0270\n1986 FZ750\n1987 FZR750\n1991 VFR750\n"}, {"text": "From: vallot@chine.ilog.fr (Joseph Vallot)\nSubject: Re: XV 3.00 has escaped!\nReply-To: vallot@chine.ilog.fr (Joseph Vallot)\nOrganization: ILOG S.A., Gentilly, France\nLines: 20\n\n\nIn article <123645@netnews.upenn.edu>, bradley@grip.cis.upenn.edu (John\nBradley) writes:\n|> From: bradley@grip.cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley)\n|> Subject: XV 3.00 has escaped!\n|> Date: 28 Apr 93 01:27:46 GMT\n|> \n|> No, not another false alarm, not a \"It'll certainly be done by *next* week\"\n|> message...
