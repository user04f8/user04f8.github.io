Rushdie was writing\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\nthe actor \"Gibreel\" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat like\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the\nArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens\nof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\nconsider Salman Rushdie's children's book \"Haroun and the Sea of\nStories\" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\n\n>to ridicule Muhammad's integrity...\n\nNo.  Muhammad's [Mahound's] integrity is not really impugned in this\npart of the story, and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie's\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\nsatanic), though he doesn't know their provenance.  It is not implied\n(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:\n\n    \" *Not my voice* I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker\n    never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice.\n      Mahound's eyes open wide, he's seeing some kind of vision,\n    staring at it, oh, that's right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He's\n    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don't\n    know, can't say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my\n    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.\n      Being God's postman is no fun, yaar.\n      Butbutbut: God isn't in this picture.\n      God knows whose postman I've been.\"\n\nIt's ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\n\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very\nexistence of a newsgroup named \"alt.atheism\" raises the same\nquestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is\nthe real relevance.  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is \"filth\nand lies\", and he \"asked for what he got\", are we next on the fatwa\nlist?

Fuel injector \ncleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is\nhooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on\nthe solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is\npricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent\nitself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to\nfit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)\n\nNot many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a \ndiscussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron\n(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best.

How do I become an astronaut?\n\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\n    specialist\".\n\n    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.

If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and\n    proper.)

Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\n    experimental operations.\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ===========================\n\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\n    --------------------------------\n\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\n    submitting an application.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be\n    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's\n    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic\n    preparation is important.\n\n    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a\n    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/150 or better uncorrected,\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\n    academic preparation is important.\n\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\n    test experience highly desirable.\n\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20/50 or better uncorrected\n\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\n\n    Citizenship Requirements\n\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\n    the United States.\n\n    Note on Academic Requirements\n\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\n\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\n\tMedical Technology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\n\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\n\n    Application Procedures\n    ----------------------\n\n    Civilian\n\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\n\n\tNASA Johnson Space Center\n\tAstronaut Selection Office\n\tATTN: AHX\n\tHouston, TX 77058\n\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\n    specified tour of duty.\n\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\n\n    Pay and Benefits\n    ----------------\n\n    Civilians\n\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\n    and experience.\n\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\n\n    Military\n\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\n    other similar military matters.\n\n\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\n"}, {"text": "From: chuck@eos.ncsu.edu (Chuck Kesler)\nSubject: Re: Ford Probe - Opinions?

I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since \nthe initial batch of cars.

It's pretty much takes up\nall the space where you'd expect to find the horn.\n\nSpeaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one\nof those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.\nThe previous Probes had Japanese horns.\n\n>Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \n\nYeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.\n\n>My Likes:\n>engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\n>handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\n>transmission (the 5 speed is a must)\n>usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\n>Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\n>stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\n>low cowl (good visibility in front)\n>Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\n>ABS/Air bag (see above)\n>rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\n>No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\n>Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nI agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.

I know that some of the very early Probes\n('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which\nFord will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like\nthis concerning the '93 Probes.\n\nI haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot\nthat was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even\ngave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my\ncar.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering\nthat I was expecting the worst from them!\n\nFrom what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with \nthe Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but \nI think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.

Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\nfeared dead.\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\" That's when\nthe real  slaughter began,\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\nsurvive. \"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\"\n    \" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\n\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\nwounds or the cold.\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\nAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\nstab wounds.\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\nkilling one person.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n           IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE\n\nThe stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:\n\n69 year old Hatin Nine telling:\n\n-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told\nme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''\n\n72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:\n\n- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.\n  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are\n  Turks, you must die.''\n\n28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:\n\n- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of\n    my eyes.''\n\nAre these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" They are saying\n\"exaggeration.\" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions?

Let's consider some \"personal interpretations\"\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\n\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\n\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\n\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\nexamining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\n\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\n\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\n\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\n\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'...\" (Articles of Faith,\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\n\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\n\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\n\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\n\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\nMcConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\n\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\n  Messianic prophecy?\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\n  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\n  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\n  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\n\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\n\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\nwhich reads:\n\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\n\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\n\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\n\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\n\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\nthe Father.\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\n  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\n  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\n  Messiah, p. 532)\n\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's \"arrest and\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\n\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\n\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\n\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\nwill be considered in this examination.\n\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\n\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in\nChrist's death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\n\n        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.\n        110:4.\n\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\n  says: \"The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\n  p. 450)\n\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\n\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\n\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\nstated:\n\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\n     (emphasis added)\n\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\nhim [Christ]...\"\n\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\nverses.\n\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\nthese Scriptures:\n\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\n\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\n\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\n\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\nthe Messiah.\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\n\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\n\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\n\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\nthe following:\n\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\n\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\n\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\n\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\n\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\nMcConkie stated the following:\n\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. \"The\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\n\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\n\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\n\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\n\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\n\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\n\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\n\n        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\nScriptures prove this fact:\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\n\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\n  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)\n  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,\n  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)\n\n  \"...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.\n  43:3)\n  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)\n\n  \"And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of\n  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\n\n  \"Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\n  22:12)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\n  \"...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1\n  Thess. 3:13)\n\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)\n  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)\n\n  \"...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...\n  (Ezek. 34:15-16)\n  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\n  (Luke 19:10)\n\n  \"For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy\n  Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)\n  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great\n  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and\n  Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;\n  Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and\n  Rev. 3:19)\n\n        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" they\nare wrong when they say He is not \"Elohim.\" The Bible reveals that\n\"Jehovah\" is the only true \"Elohim\" there is; all others are false.\nRemember, \"Jehovah\" is the personal name of the triune God who has\nrevealed Himself in the Bible.\n\n        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that \"Jehovah\" and\n\"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note\nthat not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as \"Jehovah\"\nand \"Elohim\" but so is the Holy Spirit.\n\n  \"Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I\n  will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my\n  laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And\n  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" and \"said\" added)\n  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a\n  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...\n  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\n  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will\n  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.\n  31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy\n  men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" added)\n  \"The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in\n  my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)\n\n        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that\n\"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.\n\n  \"And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,\n  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\n  Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie\n  acknowledged that \"it was\" Christ's \"voice that spoke to Moses in the\n  burning bush...\" Promised Messiah, p. 394]\n  And the LORD [Jehovah] said...\n  And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the\n  children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your\n  fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his\n  name? what shall I say unto them?\n  And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus\n  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto\n  you.\n  And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto\n  the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your\n  fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and\n  the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for\n  ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.\n  3:4,7,13-15)\n\n  \"And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD\n  [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)\n\n  \"I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God\n  [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:\n  (Isa. 45:5)\n\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\n  [Elohim], and an everlasting king...

(Ps.\n  68:4) [Regarding the word \"Jah,\" Bruce R. McConkie stated: \"Jah\n  (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all\n  of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel.\" Mormon\n  Doctrine, p. 391]\n\n  \"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from\n  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose\n  name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that\n  dwelleth between the cherubims.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\n\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah's\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\n5:27)\n\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\nBible reveals that \"Elohim's\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\n\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\n\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\n\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\n\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\nman's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\ntruth about who created man.\n\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\n  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)\n\n  \"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\n  made_....\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...

(Isa. 42:5)\n\n  \"...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of\n  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon\n  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\n\n        The Bible reveals that it is \"Jehovah\" who is the \"Elohim of the\nspirits of all flesh\" and \"of all flesh\" itself, that it was He who\n\"formed the spirit of man within him,\" that He \"made us this soul\" and\n\"formed us from the womb.\" He did indeed \"create man.\"\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\"\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\n\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\n\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\n  (emphasis added)\n\n  \"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\n\n  \"...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\n  all things that in them are.\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\n\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\n\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\n  Abraham's writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: \"We will\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\n\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\n\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\n\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\n\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\n\n        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\n\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\n\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\n\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\n\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\n\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\n\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\n\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\n  developed....\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\n  Father, and to him only....\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\n\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\n\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\n\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\n\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\n\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\n\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\n\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\n\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\n\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\n\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\n\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\nidolatry.\n\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\n\n  \"Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\n\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\n\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\n\n  \"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\n\n  \"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\n  (Josh. 23:7)\n\n  \"...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\n\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\n\n  \"And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\n\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\n\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\n  24:15-16)\n\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\nand all therein.\n\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\n\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim's\" covenant\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim's\" of\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\n\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\n\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\nworld to redeem mankind.\n\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\n\"Jehovah.\"\n\nSummary\n\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\n\n        In answer to Jesus' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\n\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\n\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\n1)\n\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\nThe Bible says:\n\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\n\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\n\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\n\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\n\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\n\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\n17:3)\n\n  \"...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you.\" (Ju. 2:3. See also\n  Exod. 23:32-33)\n\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: adam@microware.com (Adam Goldberg)\nSubject: Re: Choice of gauges\nNntp-Posting-Host: ren\nOrganization: Microware Systems Corp., Des Moines, Iowa\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 25\n\nIn article <C5yBo4.E5I@vcd.hp.com> dmunroe@vcd.hp.com (Dave Gauge) writes:\n>If you had free reign to design your own instrument cluster, which\n>gauges would you choose to have beyond the basic set?\n\nOil Pressure, Oil Temperature\nCoolant Temperature\nManifold Vacuum\nAmmeter, Voltmeter\n\nFuel Pressure [maybe] (Problematic, since you either need an electronic\nsensor/gauge pair or you have to mount the damn thing outside the car)\n\nIn addition, it'd be nice to have a big red idiot light 'Check Guages'\nconnected to Oil pressure, Oil Temp, Coolant Temp, Ammeter &\nVoltmeter.

The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any\ndecisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \"try\nsomething new\" than it is to refuse to allow it.\n\n   At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet\n(\"Who wants to get around people's feet,\" according to one of our\npriests) the congregation was \"invited\" to come up and help wash one\nanother's hands.\n\n   The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to\nparticipate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with\nrubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \"Body of Christ\" -- \"Amen\"\nfor receiving Communion), that they could be \"I am not responsible for\nthe blood of this man.\"\n\n   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\"Blessed are You, God of\nall creation...\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The\npriest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to\nothers, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion\nthat night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up\nprayers for our priests and parish).\n\n>So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\n>going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\n>Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \n>of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \n>just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\n>participation in Catholic Masses lately?\n\n   The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be\ncelebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would\nstill be \"liturgically\" beautiful.  The problem comes about from\npeople trying to be \"creative\" who are not.\n\n   I think the answer to your question on participation could be that\ngiven by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by\nthe title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  \"They don't\nwant to\" because of all this nonsense.\n\n   By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does\nnot reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are\ndisobedient to the Church in changing it on their own \"authority.\"\n\n-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nSteve Creps, Indiana University\ncreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: dmatic@athena.mit.edu (Davor Matic)\nSubject: Looking for Technics SA-GX910\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLines: 9\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: marinara.mit.edu\n\n\n\nIf you would like to sell your Technics SA-GX910 receiver, or know\nsomeone who would like to sell it, please contact me.

I am the administrator\nof csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help out\nthe needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which \nincludes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and\nother places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normally\ndisabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of\nincident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash several\nmonths ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old\nstory, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't\nremember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to\nfind out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted\nhere, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have\nalways been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with \nClipper.\n\nI posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here\nbecause csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account\ncalled 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains\nthe addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory\nBoard, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses\nof other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography,\nsecurity, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on\nthis list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information\nfirst-hand.\n\nThe 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is \nnot a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial\ntraffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get\ntraffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.\n\nWhile you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this,\nI would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives\nof the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them\nfor what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common\npractice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again\nwas unintentional.\n\n-John Wack\n  \n"}, {"text": "From: jwg@SEDV1.acd4.acd.com (jwg)\nSubject: Re: Dumbest automotive concepts of all time\nIn-Reply-To: bhtulin@unix.amherst.edu's message of Wed, 14 Apr 1993 20:35:23 GMT\nOrganization: /u/jwg/.organization\nLines: 16\n\nIn article <C5HqJ0.57@unix.amherst.edu>, bhtulin@unix.amherst.edu (Barak H.

When you encounter references to Heaven\nin terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do\nnot suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden\nstreets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the\nconcept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that\nabout the \"fires\" of Hell?\n     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the\nlast description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the\nFerris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant\nby Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this\nconnection, there are two reasons that occur to me.\n     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as\nsomething that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as\nany rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --\nbut the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS\nSHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with\nmatches).\n     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word \"Gehenna,\"\none of the words translated \"Hell\" in the New Testament. It refers\nto the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a\nplace where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)\nto Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires\nburned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem.\n\"To be cast into Gehenna\" or \"to burn in Gehenna\" thus became a\nmetaphor for \"to be rejected or discarded as worthless.\"\n\nLest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart\nis my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT\nDIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no\nflames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most\nbookstores and libraries.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n"}, {"text": "From: robert@monster.apd.saic.com (Robert W Mangum II)\nSubject: Arcade Video Games For Sale in Northern Virginia\nOrganization: SAIC Reston, VA\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 14\n\n                For Sale in Northern Virgina\n\n                     Arcade Video Games\n\n                     Asteroids     $200\n                     Omega Race    $300\n\nBoth are upright video games in excellent condition.\n __________________________     _____________________________________\n(                          )   (                                     \\\n \\   Robert W Mangum II   (_____)  Email: robert@monster.apd.saic.com \\\n  )  1005 Hertford Street  _____   Work:  (703) 318-4548               )\n /   Herndon, VA  22070   (     )  Home:  (703) 709-8022              /\n(__________________________)   (_____________________________________/\n"}, {"text": "From: sdoran@matt.ksu.ksu.edu (Steven D Marcotte)\nSubject: Data corruption\nOrganization: Kansas State University\nLines: 31\nNNTP-Posting-Host: matt.ksu.ksu.edu\n\n\nI quit windows normally to run a special DOS app, got done with it\nand tried to start windows.

Why don't you do the same.\n\nSome more interesting facts about the Waco incident:\n\n1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing\n    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least\n    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify\n    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as\n    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to\n    be police.\n    \n2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:\n    + \"We only had handguns\" - the original footage showed 4 BATF\n      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5\n      assault sub-machine gun.\n    + \"We were out gunned\" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the\n      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you\n      have the best guns available for the job.\n    + \"We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!\" -\n      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot\n      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that\n      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\n      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly\n      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are\n      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter\n      plywood.\n    + \"We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.\n       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.\n       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.\n       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.\"\n      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily\n      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.\n      \n3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one\n    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would\n    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did\n    AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh?\n\nAll in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be\ntaken with a grain or two of salt.\n\nRob.\n--\nRobert A.

Deputy Principal Srur \n Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them \n against a wall, and put their arms around them.\n \n When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat\n him with the butts of their rifles.\n \n On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising\n Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the \n soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the \n beating.\n \n On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded\n him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance.

Since they aren't fixed in position on their\nstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different\nposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of\ncontact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing\nthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the\nball, not the center cylindrical area.\n\nI've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but\nneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our\noffice's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\nhelp.\n\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If\nyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl \nalcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.\n\nIf you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see\nif it is actually causing the axle to spin. \n\nIf all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(\nIt could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be\nnecessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that\ndirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nMurray\n \n\n-- \nMurray M.

Ordinary massage\nis intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular\nor joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners\nwho take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be\nquack science to justify their technique.\n\nIn the case of massage, there is a technique called \"deep abdominal massage\"\nin which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines!\nThe notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the\nintestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease\nsyndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that\nthese deposits can be loosened up and passed out.\n\nI just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it!

To come up\nto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by\npersonality type summary file.\n\nOne observation is that people have significantly different personalities\n(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect\nto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while\nother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more\nsolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if\nconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of\npeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.\n\nMy impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and\ncreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted\n(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\npreferences have their place in the Body).\n\nMaybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\nexcerpted from my summary:\n\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\n\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\n                          world of people, activities or things.\n\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\n\n\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\nto fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects\nof how churches have not properly understood personality variances among\ntheir members to the detriment of all.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\n    microfilm.\n\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\n    from.\n\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\n    sheet design.\n\n\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\n\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\n    \"scooped\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently\n    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early\n    in a mission.\n\n\n    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES\n\n    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to\n    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium\n    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\n\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\n    pursue are:\n\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good\n    article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo's launch,\n    \"Showdown at Pad 39-B,\" by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November\n    1989 issue of *Ad Astra*.

Studies\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\n    study, Charles Jackman.\n\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\n\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\n\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Shuttle sources:\t  725,000 kilograms/year\n\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\n\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\n\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\n    do at the present time.\n\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\n    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\n    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\n\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\n    you're dying. The limits are not really known.\n\n    References:\n\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\n    Alfred G. Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).\n\n    _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.\n    Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\n\n\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\n\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\n    team's medical/forensic report.\n\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\n\n\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\n\n    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\n    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\n    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\n    spacecraft.\n\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\n\n\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\n\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\n\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't\n    know the address) to study the Face.\n\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\n    sci.astro.\n\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

Daigle has\nshown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,\nand after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being\nstupid, he's really tanked in his performance.

The founder of this\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\n\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\n\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's\ninternal resources.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal religion.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will\nofficially  end.   Voting  will be held for about three weeks. If\nthe group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  \"YES/Create\"  votes\nthan  \"NO/don't  create\"  votes;  the group shall be created.
