It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science\nCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.\n\n   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space\nMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell\nInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world\nauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or\ncoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial\nmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David\nCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.\n\n   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal\nexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build\nthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a\npotential to power the globe.\n\n   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half\nfrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific\nconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.\n\n   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar\nsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted\nthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous\nsource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever\nincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.\n\n   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space\nIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the\nNational Space Society, which is an international non-profit\norganization that promotes development of the space frontier.\nThe Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.\n\n       WHERE:  Rockwell Science Center Auditorium, 1049 Camino\n               Dos Rios, Thousand Oaks, CA.\n\n   DIRECTIONS: Ventura Freeway 101 to Thousand Oaks, exit onto\n               Lynn Road heading North (right turn from 101\n               North, Left turn from 101 South), after about 1/2\n               mile turn Left on Camino Dos Rios, after about 1/2\n               mile make First Right into Rockwell after Camino\n               Colindo, Parking at Top of Hill to the Left\n\n"}, {"text": "Subject: Re: CB750 C with flames out the exhaust!!!!---->>>\nFrom: Stafford@Vax2.Winona.MSUS.Edu (John Stafford)\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Winona State University\nNntp-Posting-Host: stafford.winona.msus.edu\nLines: 16\n\nIn article <C5w9y0.EBt@cmptrc.lonestar.org>, neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org (Neal\nHoward) wrote:\n> \n> \n> Hey, the Lone Biker of the Apocalypse (see Raising Arizona) had flames coming\n> out of both his exhaust pipes.

I believe\nthat X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics\nand displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my\npath, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but\nnot for the family I am using (Helvetica).\n\nI think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the\nresolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you\nexplicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the\nscaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command\n\nxfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).\n\nThe command  \n\nxfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).\nDespite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can\ngenerate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a\nresolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.\n\nIs this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can\ndo to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about\nmy resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).\nThis would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to\nlook at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: \"Yup, thats\nan inch\".

Generally, the individual attempts to ignore\nor suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  \nThe individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather\nthan being from an external source.\n\nExamples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,\nor other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a\nsource of the anxiety.\n\nIn OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the\nindividual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their\ndaily routine and social relationships.\n\nTreatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes\ncertain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating\nobsessions and compulsions.\n\nThe standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the\nDSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkind regards,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttodd\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Todd I.

I don't think it is the\nfunction overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time\nin BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\n\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\n\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\n\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\n  between MSC and BC).\n\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\n  references).\n\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\nnot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope\nthat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's\nhype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.\n\n-- \n      If these were my employer's opinions, I wouldn't be posting them.\n###############################################################################\n  \"Whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously  # R.

Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \nmathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't \nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \nno exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is \nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \nteachers.\"\n\nNow, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\nVenus and back.\n\n\t\t\tOne for the \"road\"\n\n\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \n\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with \n\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \n\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\n\n\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History \n\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \n\tthe Royal Astronomer.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\n\nThe book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\n\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\n\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \nproblem book.\n\n\t\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\n\n\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \n\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \n\tit the mother of all wisdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Anania of Shirak\n\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \nMovses of Khoren).\n\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\n\n\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\n\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \n\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \n\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\n\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \n\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \n\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \n\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \n\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\n\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\n\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\n\n\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \n\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \n\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \n\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \n\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \n\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \n\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\n\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \n\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \n\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\n\n\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \n\thad come. He received me graciously and said: \"I praise Our Lord that \n\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \n\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \n\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \n\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \n\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \n\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\n\tat the king's court began to envy me.\n\n\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \n\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \n\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \n\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \n\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \n\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\n\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \n\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \n\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \n\toriginally.\n\n\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \n\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \n\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \n\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \n\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \n\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \n\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \n\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \n\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \n\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \n\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \n\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \n\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \n\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\n\n\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \n\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \n\tassume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \n\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\n\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \n\twith him.\n\n\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \n\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \n\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's \n\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \n\tfor my efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\tProblems and Solutions\n\n\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\n\ton verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \n\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \n\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \n\tcopies were printed in all.\n\t\t\t\t\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\n\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\nmanuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to \nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\" Biding\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\n\nIn the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\n\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \nfull glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.\n\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \n572.\n\nProblem 1\n\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\n\nProblem 8\n\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\n\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \naccording to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \nAnania's Problems and Solutions.\n\nProblem 18\n\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\n\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \nAnania's time -- for instance, problem 7.\n\nProblem 7\n\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\n\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself\nand offer you just one more.\n\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\n\nProblem 20\n\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\n\n\t\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\n\n\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \n\tbibliography.\n\t\t\t\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\n\t\t\t\t\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\n\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \nof Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\n\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\n\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \nwere hard.

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\n\nI don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\nIts the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\ngovernment going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\n\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\ngunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".  I think it could be\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\nand firing, you know.

We can't\neven protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come out\nwith it.\n\nSee, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and the\ncordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method\n(I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to put\na rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into a\ntruck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything.\nSince that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain or\ncable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on\nto the next bike.\n\n(Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!  :-)\n\n|Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off\n|by such a trival tactic. WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft,\n|the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock-picker to walk away with your\n|property!  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock\n|of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned.\n\nWhat tactic are you referring to?  If we don't know what you are talking about,\nwe can't very well guard against it, can we?\n\nFor my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm\nwith pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&C\ninsurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people\nabout.  (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of\nstealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious,\nthey'll set off the alarm.)\n\nThat's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its\nactual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would\nWANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make\na profit on the deal.  :-)\n\nSeriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week,\nand (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking,\nbut useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a\ncurb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cable\nlocks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or\nthe cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friend\ncome buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  The\nonly thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over \nwinter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm).\n\nOh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and\nplace them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off.\n\nThat's the best that I can think of.  Most of the locks I see people put\non bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound.  I like ABUS, since I have\npersonally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot.\n\nDave Svoboda (svoboda@void.rtsg.mot.com)    | \"I'm getting tired of\n90 Concours 1000 (Mmmmmmmmmm!)              |  beating you up, Dave.\n84 RZ 350 (Ring Ding) (Woops!)              |  You never learn.\"\nAMA 583905  DoD #0330  COG 939  (Chicago)   |  -- Beth \"Bruiser\" Dixon\n"}, {"text": "From: jar2e@faraday.clas.Virginia.EDU (Virginia's Gentleman)\nSubject: Re: Israeli Terrorism\nOrganization: University of Virginia\nLines: 12\n\nWould it be asking too much for you to DOCUMENT these allegations of\n\"Israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters\"?

Xt Glossary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\n\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\n  widgets or gadgets.\n\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Related FAQ's\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\n\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \ncomp.windows.x.  \n\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \nto comp.windows.x.motif.\n\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\n\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\n\nWhy don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.\n\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly\nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\non the visual being used.  \n\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\nlittle harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\n\n/*\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\n * than the default visual.\n *\n * To compile:\n *\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\n *\n * To run:\n *\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\n *\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\n * to install.\n */\n\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n\tVisual\t*visual;\n\tint\tdepth;\n} OptionsRec;\n\nOptionsRec\tOptions;\n\nXtResource resources[] =\n{\n\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\n\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\n\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n};\n\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\n{\n\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\n\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\n};\n\n\n\nint\nmain (argc, argv)\n\tint\t\targc;\n\tchar\t\t**argv;\n{\n\tXtAppContext\tapp;\t\t/* the application context */\n\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\t/* toplevel widget */\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\t\t/* display */\n\tchar\t\t**xargv;\t/* saved argument vector */\n\tint\t\txargc;\t\t/* saved argument count */\n\tColormap\tcolormap;\t/* created colormap */\n\tXVisualInfo\tvinfo;\t\t/* template for find visual */\n\tXVisualInfo\t*vinfo_list;\t/* returned list of visuals */\n\tint\t\tcount;\t\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\n\tArg\t\targs[10];\n\tCardinal\tcnt;\n\tchar\t\t*name = \"test\";\n\tchar\t\t*class = \"Test\";\n\n\t/*\n\t * save the command line arguments\n\t */\n\n\txargc = argc;\n\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\n\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\n\n\t/*\n\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\n\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\n\t */\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\n\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\n\tcnt = 0;\n\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\n\t\t\t\t   XtNumber (resources),\n\t\t\t\t   args, cnt);\n\tcnt = 0;\n\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\n\t{\n\t\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\n\t\t/*\n\t\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\nsuch).\n\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\nor just monochrome.\n\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above \nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\nshell.\n\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\n\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\nvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\n\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\nlist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among\nother things.\n\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\n\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\texit (0);\n\t}\n\nOne can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\noccur.  \n\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\n\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\ndifficult to maintain practices.\n\nTry the following code instead.\n\n\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n\n\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern void ExitCallback (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\n\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\n\t}\n\n\tBoolean\n\tExitWorkProc (closure)\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\n\t{\n\t\texit (0);\n\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\n\t}\n\n\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\n\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\nnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\nOS's it is the poll() system call.\n\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\n\nIt's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\nreliable.  In particular:\n\n\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\n\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\n\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\n\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\n\n\t- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\n\n\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\n\t  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\n\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\n\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\n\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\n\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\n\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\n\t  been given the whole block).\n\n\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this\npoint I don't know.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective\nit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full\ndetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already\nfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may\nnot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which\nmeans its a 1000 pages.\n\nAsente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \"X Window System Toolkit, The\n\tComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification\", Digital Press,\n\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\n\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC\n\tDirect at 1-800-DIGITAL.\n\nThe other book I commonly recomend to novices is:\n\nYoung, Doug. \"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with\n\tXt (Motif Version),\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).\n\t(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)\n\nAnd of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.\nO'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt\nreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively\noverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it\nvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to\nother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related\ninformation.\n\nI read two periodicals, \"The X Resource\" and the \"The X Journal\".\nThese are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \"The X Resource\"\nis published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the\nMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no\nadvertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For\norders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial\nmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at\nmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in\n~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.\n\n\n\"The X Journal\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.\nThe articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical\naudience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an\nexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a\nfairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good\ncollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call\n(908) 563-9033.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n14. What Widgets are available?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three popular widget sets:\n\nAthena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\n\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\n\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\nMotif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\n\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\n\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\n\t  it is poorly implemented.\nOLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\n\t  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\n\t  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\n\t  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\n\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\n\nXtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\n\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\n\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\n\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\n\t  them so I can't comment.\nFWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\n\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\n\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\n\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\n\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\nXcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\n\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\n\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\n\t  widely used.\nXs\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\n\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\nXw\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\n\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\n\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\n\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\n\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\n\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\nXo\t- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you\n\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\n\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\n\nTbl\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\n\t  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.\nPlots\t- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\n\t  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t__________________________________________\n\tName\t\tLanguage\tVendor\n\t__________________________________________\n\tXview\t\tC\t\tSun\n\tOI\t\tC++\t\tParcPlace\n\tInterviews\tC++\t\tStanford\n\tTcl/tk\t\tC\t\tsprite.berkeley.edu\n\t__________________________________________\n\n\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\n\ttypdef struct\n\t{\t\n\t    String\tname;\n\t    long\tvalue;\n\t} Arg;\n\nand the code:\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\n\nexpands to\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\targ.name = \"name\";\n\targ.value = 3.2;\n\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\nhow to get around this?\n\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\n\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\n    } else { \\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\n    }\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\n\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\n\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\n\n    string to data type\n    data type to string\n    data type to data type\n\ni) string to data type\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n\n\tName\t\tValue\n\t\"True\"\t\t1\n\t\"False\"\t\t0\n\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n    of the converters.\n\nii) data type to string\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\n\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n    that they are consistent.\n\niii) data type to data type\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n    red, green and blue.\n\n\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\n\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\n\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\n    Display *dpy;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\n\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\nconverted value:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    unsigned int    size;\n    caddr_t         addr;\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\n\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\nreturn True.\n\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\n\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\n\t    { \\\n\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n\t      return False; \\\n\t    } \\\n\t  else \\\n\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n      return True;\n\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n\t  return False; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n      return True;\n\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\nconverter is being called properly.\n\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\n\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    XtAppContext context;\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\nXtSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\nused.\n\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\n\n    XtCacheNone\t\tDon't cache any converted values\n    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values\n    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basis\n\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\n\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\n\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\n\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\n    XtAppContext context;\n    XrmValuePtr to;\n    XtPointer converter_data;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\n\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\nR5 distribution:\n\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\nand remove it from the application context.\n\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\nhappen 3 ways:\n\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\n\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\n\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\n\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\n\nI'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\n\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\nproblem.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\ndemonstrates this:\n\n#include <setjmp.h>\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\n\nvoid\nXIOHandler (dpy)\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\n{\n\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\n\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n\t...\n\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\n\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\n}\n\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\npurpose it is adequate.\n\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\nconnect to a display.\n\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\n\n\t1. Args passed at creation time.\n\t2. Command line arguments.\n\t3. User's per host defaults file\n\t4. User's defaults file.\n\t5. User's per application default file.\n\t6. System wide per application default file.\n\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\n\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\n\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nbut most do not.\n\nA user may have many per application default files containing\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\nis found.\n\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\n\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\n\n\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\n\t\tapplication's class name.\n\t%T\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n\t\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\n\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\n\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\n\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n\t%t\tThe territory part of the display's language string\n\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display's language string\n\nLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\nLet's consider another example. This time, let's set\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\n\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\n\nWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\nlike this:\n\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\n\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\nbatch of default settings.)\n\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\n\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\nguarantee the order of execution.\n\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\nlist.\n\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\nsays:\n\n \t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\n \tprocedure is to be appended.\"\n \nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\nlist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\n\n> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible\n> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core\n> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag\n> stays set to TRUE.\n\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\n\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\n\n> Is this a problem with \"mwm\" or is there something\n> else which needs to be done?\n\nYou'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\n\n> If the problem is \"mwm\", what is the fastest\n> way to determine if a window is iconified? \n\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\nsuggestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can't.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\nhandled something like:\n\n\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t{\n\t\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\n\t\texit (1)\n\t}\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\n\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\n\telse\n\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\n\t++count;\n\nto be written as:\n\n\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\n\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\n\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\nstructure or copying a string:\n\n\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\n\t  char\t     *ptr;\n\t  char\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\n\n\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\n\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\n\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\n\n\t char\t      *ptr;\n\n\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\n\t /* ... */\n\t free (ptr);\n\nmay not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\n\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, I'd recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey\nat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\n\n\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\n\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\n\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\n\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\n\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\n\tmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\n\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\n\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\n\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\n\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\n\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\n\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\n\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\n\nAn alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\nmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\nfor more info)\n\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\nserver are asynchronous.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\nFor example:\n\n    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &\n    example% xwininfo -tree\n\t     <click in new xload window>\n\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\nof errant widgets.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\ntest the way a widget manages it's children, you can try\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\nof both.  It's a very clever idea.\n\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\nUnfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to\nyour application which is stopped.\n\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\nusing a command sequence like this:\n\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\n\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\n\tor this:\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% gdb application\n\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\n\t(gdb) run ...\n\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\n\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\ndeal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \n\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\nyou won't get those events.\n\nFor example:\n\n\t...\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\n\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\n\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\n\n\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\n\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\n\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\n\nwould never invoke the timeout.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\n\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\n``intuitive'' fashion.\n\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\n\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\nprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\nas it is based on Xt).\n\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\nconventions, for more details read the code.\n\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\nanyway.\n\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     \"being.\"  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).

Worthwhile.  Laughs & serious questions about real religion.\nKeywords: Eveism, religion, \nNntp-Posting-Host: rs6101.ecs.rpi.edu\nOrganization: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy NY\nLines: 102\n\nLet me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \ncommon.\n\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\n\nFor example,\n\nStory of Adam and Eve:\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\n\nTraditional Philosophy:\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This\nis why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \nquestion by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.\n\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\n\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \nthemselves.\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\n\n1990's philosophy:\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\n\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\n\nLessons from new interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\nis ideal.\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.

They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in\nquantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info\nabout simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest\nMims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with\nresistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math\nto get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a\n555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate\ndoing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz\nto about 500 KHz (I think).\n\nAbout the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to\nuse one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio\nline (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.\n\nThe data line is probably most easily done\nby some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565\nchip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing\nabout how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp\ninformation can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack\ninfo-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.\nSetting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I\nwould suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is\ngoing into, so I am really generalizing...\n\nAs for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I\nsuggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would\nbe the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making.\nHope that clears things......\n\n-squish@endor.harvard.edu\n\n"}, {"text": "From: rwert@well.sf.ca.us (Bob Wert)\nSubject: Need advice for riding with someone on pillion\nSummary: Advice wanted for when I take someone on the back of the moto.\nKeywords: advice, pillion, help!\nNntp-Posting-Host: well.sf.ca.us\nOrganization: Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link\nDistribution: na\nLines: 22\n\nI need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.\nThis will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride\n(read: farther than around the block  :-).

They speak Serbo-Croatian. But\nthere is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian\nand anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by\nchanging religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric\nwho brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls\n\"the people\" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals\ncall all the Bosnian Muslims \"Turks\" even though they are not ethnically\nTurk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,\nwhat is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically\nidentical but religiously \"other\" is called, paradoxically, \"ethnic\ncleansing\" rather than \"religious cleansing.\"\n\nThus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of\nWWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from\nBosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike.\n>\n--\nMichael Sells, Department of Religion, Haverford College\nHaverford, Pa 19041-1392\n"}, {"text": "From: mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\nSubject: Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\nSummary: Hi.

In addition, people often request information which has\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\ntitles:\n\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\n   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\n\nThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The\nothers are entirely optional.\n\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \"A Primer on How to Work With\nthe Usenet Community\", \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\"\nand \"Hints on writing style for Usenet\" are particularly relevant.  Questions\nconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.\n\nIf you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \"Finding\nStuff\" section below.\n\n\n                                   Credits\n\nThese files could not have been written without the assistance of the many\nreaders of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them\nto anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the\nauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it\ndoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating\naround the network.\n\n\n                                Finding Stuff\n\nAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\n   the following lines:\n\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\n\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\n   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\n   \"send atheism/index\".\n\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n\n\nmathew\n\u00ff\n"}, {"text": "From: hades@coos.dartmouth.edu (Brian V.
