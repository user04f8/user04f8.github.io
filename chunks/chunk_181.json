Despite its small size and quickness,\n  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:\n  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,\n  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or\n  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\n  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\n  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\n  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\n  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\n  \n  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\n  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\n  \n  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n  \n  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\n  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\n  \n  Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display\n==========================================================\n\nPC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)\n======================\n\nIMDISP\n------\n  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give \nyour question a shot. \n\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \npages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not \ntoner.  But that should go without saying.\n\nMy PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little \nwhile to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once \nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \n\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or \nHP wouldn't sell many......\n\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \nlike a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.\n\nFinally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like \na good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not \nas impressive.  \n\nSo, I chose the Canon.

Given:\n\n1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security,\nand the expense of key distribution etc., imply that the clients\nreally do want that level of security\n\n2. These same people want to keep P a secret\n\nI find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P\nlying around.\n\n(I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small\npart of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in\nC her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I find\nthis at least as surprising.)\n\nBack to the question:\n\nIf I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, I\nwould also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using up\nthe next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original\nquestion basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the\nmessage with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,\nand I don't know the answer. However, I would propose the following\nfor discussion.\n\nAlice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to\nshare, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by\nknowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they\nCORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to\nbe created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not\nknow which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,\nshe would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.\n\nWhat is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.\n(Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't\nhave exactly the same effect).\n\nNow, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC\ncomputed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad):\n  1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S\n  2. break C2 into n-bit chunks\n  3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)\n  4. for i in each chunk sequentially\n       set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]\n\nAt the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.\n\n(Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the\nplaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in\nthe same manner.)\n\nNLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub. The simplest\nnon-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed\n(even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable table\ncalled Sbox, and use:\n  x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y].\n\nPractically speaking, I think this solves your problem, as Eve never\nsees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid\nsubstitution on it.\n\nAlso practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32\nbits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you might\nwork on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I think that is an irrelevant detail\nfor the discussion at hand.\n\nWho will be first to point out my errors, or give me a pointer to some\nliterature?\n--\nGreg Rose                 Australian Computing and Communications Institute\nggr@acci.com.au                                              +61 18 174 842\n`Use of the standard phrase \"HIJACKED\" may be inadvisable' -- CAA\n"}, {"text": "From: Grant@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL (Lynn R Grant)\nSubject: Re: Once they get your keys....\nOrganization: Yale CS Mail/News Gateway\nLines: 16\n\nAbout 50 people so far have asked, \"Once the FBI gets your Clipper keys,\nwon't they be able to read all your future and past traffic?\"\n\nThere has been no response from NIST, NSA, Ms. Denning, Mr. Hellman, or\nanyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer.\nThis is troubling.\n\nDidn't NSA think about this?

Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 105\n\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kevin\nBass would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 49.4% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra \nBases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nGonzalez, L.    63    28    20   .192    .866\nGilkey, B.      52    23    14   .150    .941\nClark, G.       46    11    11   .065    .726\nAlou, M.        20     3    12   .052    .835\nBonds, B.       54     9    -7   .019   1.099\nMay, D.         21     0    -7  -.020    .659\nGant, R.        31    -5    -2  -.021    .715\nBass, K.         0   -24    -4  -.126    .600\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n1.099 Bonds\n .941 Gilkey\n .866 Gonzalez\n .835 Alou\n .726 Clark\n .718 *NL Average*\n .715 Gant\n .659 May\n .600 Bass\n\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nRaines, T.      53    22    20   .111    .896\nAnderson, B.    65    30     8   .102    .924\nHenderson, R.   43    20     4   .101    .984\nVaughn, G.      55    27    -3   .095    .817\nGladden, D.     25     4     8   .038    .699\nHall, M.        29     6    -2   .017    .756\nMack, S.        38     6    -8   .005    .866\nPolonia, L.     10   -11    10  -.019    .647\nMcReynolds, K.  13    -8    -9  -.064    .711\nMaldanado, C.    9   -21   -12  -.105    .714\nReimer, K.       5   -18   -16  -.102    .671\n\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.984 Henderson\n.924 Anderson\n.896 Raines\n.866 Mack\n.817 Vaughn\n.756 Hall\n.733 *AL Average*\n.714 Maldanado\n.711 McReynolds\n.699 Gladden\n.671 Reimer\n.647 Polonia\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM\nport, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just\nsearches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The\nfirst equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by\nthe rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set\nof \"standard\" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the\norder in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for\nserial ports.\n\nSo, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were\nthis address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS\nto determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the\nfield in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that\nthere are but 3 COMM ports installed.

RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the\n four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection\n (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and\n non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \"What is PEM?\")\n\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\n\n The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the\n Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.\n\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\n\n RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\n to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or\n Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained\n (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were\n shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something\n weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may\n change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the\n README file that this law not be violated:\n\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\n\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\n RIPEM.\n\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent\n residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README\n file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a\n product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping\n distribute it.\n\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\n ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\n how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\n\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\n\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\n\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\n\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\n Emacs.\n\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\n\n5)  What is RSA?\n\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\n you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your\n decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\n decrypt it.  Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\n the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \"What is DES?\")\n\n Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For\n originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of\n origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message\n (See \"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\") is encrypted with the\n sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving\n authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm\n that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.\n\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\n invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography\n in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information\n also may be in sci.crypt.\n\n6)  What is DES?\n\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\n\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\n recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\n\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\n corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM\n standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the\n near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be\n stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with\n interoperability.\n\n7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\n\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\n\n MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,\n RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so\n parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate\n channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.\n\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\n\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\n RFC 1321.\n\n There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong\n a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash\n function will be used if this is accepted as true.\n\n8)  What is PEM?\n\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of\n encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a\n working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\n\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\n\n9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?\n\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\n\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\n None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for\n key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM\n is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.\n\n10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\n\n This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,\n the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section\n 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be\n met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421\n addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key\n cryptography.\n\n This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that\n everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of\n patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key\n cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive\n (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter\n and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are\n compressed with a patented algorithm.)\n\n11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\n\n RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company\n specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a\n firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.\n patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:\n\n      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method\n      (\"Diffie-Hellman\")............................... No. 4,200,770\n\n      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Merkle\").................... No. 4,218,582\n\n      Cryptographic Communications System and\n      Method (\"RSA\")................................... No. 4,405,829\n\n      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Pohlig\").................... No. 4,424,414\n\n PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key\n cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for\n example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)\n PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of\n companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their\n products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their\n patents.\n\n RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than\n its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its\n author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.\n However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got\n interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some\n people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing\n code.  RIPEM even won the \"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\"\n award.\n\n12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\n\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography\n Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the\n key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as\n those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys\n are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were\n generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.\n\n13)  What is PGP?\n\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\n\n A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\n\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\n   a direct network connection.\n\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability\n   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be\n   compatible with anything other than itself.\n\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which\n   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own\n   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its\n   patents to \"make, use or sell\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without\n   either a license or written permission.  (See: \"DISCLAIMER\")\n   (See: \"What about RSADSI/PKP?\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of\n   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal\n   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but\n   it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening\n   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:\n\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \n   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\n   #contraband.\n\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\n   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP\n   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.\n\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\n Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,\n which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to\n liability concerns.\n\n14)  What about RPEM?\n\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\n an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was\n written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.\n\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\n (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough\n to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally\n accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.\n\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\n\n15)  What is MIME?\n\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\n comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with\n MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution\n of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM\n messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft\n Internet documents exist on the matter.\n\n16)  What is TIS/PEM?\n\n Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy\n Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was\n rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)\n rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know\n much more than that.\n\n17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\n\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and\n what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main \"weak area\" is\n probably key distribution.\n"}, {"text": "From: ai598@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Mike Sturdevant)\nSubject: Re: Ed must be a Daemon Child!!\nArticle-I.D.: usenet.1pqhvu$go8\nReply-To: ai598@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Mike Sturdevant)\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH (USA)\nLines: 22\nNNTP-Posting-Host: slc10.ins.cwru.edu\n\n\nIn a previous article, svoboda@rtsg.mot.com (David Svoboda) says:\n\n>In article <1993Apr2.163021.17074@linus.mitre.org> cookson@mbunix.mitre.org (Cookson) writes:\n>|\n>|Wait a minute here, Ed is Noemi AND Satan?

It was a bit shorter\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\nbare-bones.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\nin.\n\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\n\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\nthe difference.\n\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \n\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\n\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\npart first.\n\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\n\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\nthis point.\n\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\nto persue work on their own.\n\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\ntrying to do something with it.  \n\nAnybody know anything further?\nIs this really news?\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?\n\n                    John.\n"}, {"text": "From: rrpolder@cs.ruu.nl (Roderick Polder)\nSubject: Re: DXF to PCX,GIF,TIF or TGA?\nOrganization: Utrecht University, Dept. of Computer Science\nLines: 15\n\nIn <murashiea.16@mail.beckman.com> murashiea@mail.beckman.com (Ed Murashie) writes:\n\n>Does anyone know of a program for the PC that\n>will take AutoCad DXF format files and convert\n>them to a raster format, like PCX, GIF, etc?\n>Thanks in advance....\n>\t\t\t\tED\n\nI'm also interested in such a program.

The\n>difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun-related.  \n\n        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques\nof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come\nto mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost\nentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed\nfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you\ncompared the white majority they were virutally identical.\n\n        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.\nnon-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative\nconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of\nnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into\naccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in the\nsame conditions.\n\n        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,\nthen we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are\narguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far\nhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only\nnot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly\nlower.\n\n>>  -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city\n>\n>Surprise.

As such  if there is a condition\nwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent\ncrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control\nis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one\nCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control\nin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase\nin violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently\nthey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in\nthe early eighties.\n\n>>  -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already\n>\n>Post hoc ergo propter hoc.  Those areas implemented gun control because of\n>the high rates.  \n\n       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where\ngun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that\ncrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.\n\n       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high\nor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact\nviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it\nwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by\nsaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted\nto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you\ncan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of\nthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control\nwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.\n\n>Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.\n\n       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent\nof gun control.\n\n>And the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in \n>Washington D.C. may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there.\n\n       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what\nothers did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would\nsell to them?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\n\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\nwith one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\nfrom the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.\n\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\nof understanding why.\n\nP.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\nYou don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't\nknow me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the\nperson may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic\nremarks.\n-- \nStan Armstrong.

It is not comprehensive,\n##but, it is well researched.  I imagine your library has it or can get it\n##for you through interlibrary loan.\n##\n\n  I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)\n\n##In short, Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre-\n##ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  He assumed that\n##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by-\n##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\n##it)?  \n##\n\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\nscience.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into\nyour mouth either). \n\n   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can\nnot make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.\n\n   Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to\nbe scientific treatises. So I am just requesting the theists to stop making\nsuch wild claims.\n\n--- Vinayak\n-------------------------------------------------------\n                                           vinayak dutt\n                                   e-mail: vdp@mayo.edu\n\n             standard disclaimers apply\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: MLINDROOS@FINABO.ABO.FI (Marcus Lindroos INF)\nSubject: Re: Caps moving ?????\nIn-Reply-To: berger@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu's message of Thu, 22 Apr 1993 20:57:10 GMT\nOrganization: Abo Akademi University, Finland\nX-News-Reader: VMS NEWS 1.24\nLines: 26\n\nIn <berger.735512230@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu> berger@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu writes:\n\n> I've heard rumors recently from reliable sources that Abe Polin, the\n> moron who owns the Washington Capitals is looking to move the team\n> after this season or next.

I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on\nthe Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on\nthe PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware\nahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing\nhas allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.\n\nIn general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides\nare set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the\nPS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.\nWhen I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.\nI can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the\ntransmission is error free.\nBut straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.\nUnless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human\ntyping.

If you can do it, please\ntell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am\ntalking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some\nkind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.\n\nRight now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because\nof the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds\nbecause of some crazy reason I don't understand.\n\nCould I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information\nout the serial port of a Duo 210 fast?

Schmidt)\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\nKeywords: spline rasterization\nLines: 38\n\n\n\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \nsolutions to it.\n\n\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \nthe object we \n\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\n\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\n\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\n\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\n\tmeasure.\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\n\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\n\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\n3) Depth sort the triangles\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\n\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\n\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\n\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\n\n\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\narea.\n\n-Thanks\n"}, {"text": "From: jennifer@arts.com (Jennifer Witt)\nSubject: space camp\nOrganization: Computer Arts, Portland Oregon, USA\nLines: 18\n\n\n\nI'm replying to someone who asked for information on space camp.\nI have a brochure that has all different schedules.

Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke.

Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses.
