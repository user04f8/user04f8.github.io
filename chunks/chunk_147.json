The founder of this\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\n\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\n\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\ntural backgrounds.\n\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal brotherhood.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\n\"NO/don't create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \n\n\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \n====================\n\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\nnewsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third\nparty.\n\nQUESTIONS OR COMMENTS:\n=====================\n\n        Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup\nmay be sent to:\n     Nabeel A.

(A ``block\n  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,\n  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of\n  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern\n  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks\n  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre\n  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product\n  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,\n  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,\n  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.\n\n  The following table compares the main parameters of several product \n  ciphers:\n\n  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds\n  LUCIFER          128               128                16\n  DES               64                56                16\n  LOKI              64                64                16\n  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5\n  PES               64               128                 8\n\n* What makes a product cipher secure?\n\n  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is\n  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the\n  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be\n  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends\n  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown\n  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a\n  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''\n  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a\n  complex nonlinear fashion.\n\n  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are\n  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES\n  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a\n  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria\n  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be\n  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].\n\n* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\n\n  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.\n  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,\n  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit\n  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit\n  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.\n  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all\n  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from\n  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate\n  a large subset of S_{2^N}.\n\n  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple\n  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a\n  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the\n  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all\n  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)\n  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show\n  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number\n  of rounds.\n\n  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the\n  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an\n  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does\n  not exist a third key K3 such that\n\n  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)\n\n  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys\n  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If\n  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then\n  we say that E is a group.\n\n  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was\n  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their\n  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a\n  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].\n\n* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\n\n  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under\n  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K\n  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.\n  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K\n  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some\n  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial\n  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot\n  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal\n  decision is no better than simply guessing.\n\n  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers\n  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by\n  random boolean functions.\n\n* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\n\n  There are four standard \"modes of operation\" (and numerous non-standard\n  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.\n  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,\n  published in 1980.  See the question about \"ECB\" below for more details.\n\n  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \"modes of\n  operation\" can be used with any block cipher.\n\n* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\n\n  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself\n  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself \n  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one\n  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and \n  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages\n  that were authenticated using that key.\n  \n  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message\n  authentication using DES.\n\n* What exactly is DES?\n\n  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product \n  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  \n\n  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].\n  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.\n  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)\n  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. \n\n* What is triple DES?\n\n  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit \n  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES\n  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.\n  The \"DES modes of operation\" may also be used with triple-DES.\n\n  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.\n\n  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985\n  \"Financial Institution Key Management\" and is intended for use in\n  encrypting DES keys and IVs for \"Automated Key Distribution\".  Its\n  formal name is \"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key\n  Pair\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.\n\n  That standard says (section 7.2.1): \"Key encrypting keys may be a single\n  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional\n  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long\n  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a\n  single key.\"\n\n  Others use the term \"triple-DES\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or\n  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).\n\n  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form\n  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance\n  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on\n  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key\n  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on\n  its own part.)\n\n* What is differential cryptanalysis?\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be\n  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on\n  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by\n  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the\n  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.\n  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,\n  notably FEAL [BI91a].\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of\n  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a\n  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the\n  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required\n  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required\n  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key\n  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.\n  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many\n  known plaintexts.\n\n  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling\n  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key\n  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,\n  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus\n  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.\n  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that\n  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant\n  improvement in the differential attack.\n\n  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say\n  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence\n  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''\n\n* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\n\n  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that\n  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES\n  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not\n  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of\n  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in\n  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their\n  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,\n  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes\n  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....\n  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep\n  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''\n  \n  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in\n  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States\n  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE\n  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development\n  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;\n  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and\n  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their\n  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''\n\n  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.\n  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the\n  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense\n  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman\n  presented above.\n\n* Is DES available in software?\n\n  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for\n  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];\n  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].\n  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].\n\n  FIPS 46-1 says \"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be\n  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...\n  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in\n  compliance with this standard.\"  Despite this, software\n  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.\n\n* Is DES available in hardware?\n\n  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.\n  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.\n\n  Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES\n  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM\n  telecom data streams. It is capable of processing data in real time,\n  e.g. one sample/frame. It is the DS2160. Their phone number is\n  214-450-0400. You would probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom\n  marketing.''\n\n  Christian Franke, franke@informatik.rwth-aachen.de, says: ``1.\n  Cryptech CRY12C102: 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet, with 32 Bit\n  interface. We use this one, because it was the only one available when\n  we started the project. No problems !  2. Pijnenburg PCC100: 20Mbit/s\n  according to Data Sheet.

They can be reached at (613) 820-0024.\n\n* Can DES be used to protect classified information?\n\n  DES is not intended to protect classified data.  FIPS 46-1 says:\n  \"This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for\n  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following\n  conditions apply: 1.  ...  cryptographic protection is required; and\n  2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act\n  of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.\"\n\n* What are \"ECB\", \"CBC\", \"CFB\", and \"OFB\" encryption?\n\n  These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt \n  messages, files, and blocks of data, known as \"modes of operation.\"\n  Four \"modes of operation\" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2), \n  and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.   \n\n  FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the\n  unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.\n  FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.\n\n  The four DES modes of operation are: \n\tElectronic Code Book  (ECB), \n\tCipher Block Chaining (CBC), \n\tK-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and \n\tK-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).\n\n  These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.\n\n  Some symbols:\n\n  P[n]\tThe n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from\n  \tdecryption.

I personally am concerned only with a small lab  \nwith ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  \nadmin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  \nthan a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  \nyour program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   \n\"Pirate board\" or no pirate board.  I too have \"friends\" who blatantly and  \nquite successfuly \"hack\" copy protection schemes practically in their  \nsleep.\n\nLet's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  \nmachine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  \nsetting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  \nmostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  \nadministrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  \n(partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and \"acting\" similar to  \nthe average user, and maintaining \"behind-the-scenes\" consistency is a  \nreal headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  \ndifferent folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  \ndisk.\n\nOften we have hardware problems at peak \"business\" times and have to do  \nsome parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .\n\nWell, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..\n\nThe point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  \nfiles etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  \nto do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  \nCOPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  \nmachine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  \nten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  \nthis considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  \nall network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.\n\nOften, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  \nto one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  \nusually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  \nthe original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with \"copy  \nprotection\" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  \n . .\n\nIn short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  \nof like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  \nyou will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  \nguide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  \nREGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  \nthe manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  \nplease take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  \ncosts of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  \nlegitimate user with a \"copy protection\" scheme!\n\n\nSorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-)\n\n\nMark S.

So as we \nput out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national \npolice organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to \n10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At \n11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on \nhis way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At \n12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval \nOffice.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.\nThen from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the \nvarious groups.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A photo op with Vessey?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about the lunch?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he meeting with any congress people today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are no meetings --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, \nno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President been given any information by the \nPentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report \nfrom Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the \nVietnamese on that subject?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order \nof business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll \ndiscuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the \nparameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't \ndrawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's \nsomething that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese \nabout first.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President talk with any Republican senators \nyesterday about the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How many times?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last \nnight.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the outcome of that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind \nof an agreement on a jobs package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any \nway flexible on this?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going \nto get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll \ncontinue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some \nkind of an agreement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they discuss the VAT tax?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you check that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n\n\t     Q\t  So what are they -- is the President offering to \nscale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down \nto where Dole will sign on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it \nas he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs \npackage through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as \nwe reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the \nmoment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress \nincluding, obviously, Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody else?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other \nRepublicans yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I \nwouldn't rule it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We were led to believe that the President called \nMr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the \nconversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several \npeople on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the \nstimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation \nhe would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the \nconversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, \nbut it was both.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In the President's mind, are they linked \npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \nthe American people?  Has he made that argument?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what \narguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed \nto both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people \nfirst.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional \nRussian aid last night in Tokyo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does the President believe that the stimulus \npackage will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for \nRussian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to \ncontinue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs \npackage, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs \npackage through the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating \nnow with Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the \nSenate for the jobs package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other \nthan Shelby?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a \nvote.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about Kohl?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Kohl and Feingold?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll \ncontinue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to \nbring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of \nthe members of the United States Senate support the package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, \nwhy did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of \nprojects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose \nfunding if this jobs package doesn't pass.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \nother Republicans again today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but \nagain, I wouldn't rule it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \nany other states today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of \nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \nthink it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \nup, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \nhow their states would benefit from this package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will you share those with us?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent \nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \nbeen given?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think \nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \nhas not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add \nto that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are \ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going \nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't \nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public \ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think \nI want to add to that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In February, though, the President said that this \nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \nchange its mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They're \nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \nspecific options that will be covered by the President's health care \nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \non it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being \nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President's \ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then suddenly --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What happened?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \ntax.\n\n\t     Q\t  But the President himself took this off the table, \nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \nhasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \nlooking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and \nno decisions have been made.\n\n\t     Q\t  And it raises the question of how independently the \ntask force is working.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \nall options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're \nconsidering all options.\n\n\t     Q\t  But that's not the impression that the President \nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \nnot on the table, not an option. \n\n\t     Q\t  \"If it changes I'll tell you.\"\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Bring him on.\n\n\t     Q\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President's \nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna \nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \n--\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a \nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \ncouple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We \nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Is it because he has very few options?\n\n\t     Q\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the \ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \nthe President?  \n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at \nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \ncontext, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been \nmade, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a \ndecision on.\n\n\t     Q\t  They will present it to him as one of his options, \nthough he specifically ruled it out?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \nthis form of taxation?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The \nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \nthey're looking at is the VAT. \n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \nthat you were telling us that it was not?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of \ntheir drafting of options is.  I don't know.\n\n\t     Q\t  Who was telling you that it was not under \nconsideration?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's \ncomments.\n\n\t     Q\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise \nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made \non how to pay for the health care plan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'm asking whether the projections --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how \nthe plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going \nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \nyou can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \nuntil you know.\n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer \nmodels on a number of possible packages.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \n\n\t     Q\t  The question is whether they have now determined \nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're \nnot going to answer until -- there's a number of options being \nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And when the President has been meeting with health \ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \n--\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     they have never once said to him, these are your \nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \nin his --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \nnature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular \nbriefings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, you have.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not \nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \nhim as an option.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of \nwhat's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't \nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of \npaying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  \nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \nit's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process \nof the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  \nIt's something that the working groups will present to him among the \nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not \ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \nhealth care issues are being discussed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's your statement from this podium that no \ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \nthe option has not been presented to him.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \nby George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \nnothing to add to what's already been said.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \nso that it would be less regressive?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what \nmight happen if.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \nyou'd exclude food and energy --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific \nstructure of a decision that hasn't been made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's \ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \ngroups?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you check for us, because that's a real \nimportant credibility question?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since the task force was brought together this \nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \nand a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be \nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  \nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \nadd.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if \nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \nit's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \nus.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come \nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or \ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about \nthis issue.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  All we were trying to find out --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out \nand I've given you the answers, Helen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made \nit an option again.  That's the --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you \ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously \nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll \npresent it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \nthe table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \nhis mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he change his mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a \ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's \nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \nthis we'll let you know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So he must have changed his mind, right?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \n--\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he \nchanged his mind or the working groups think they're authority \nexceeds the President's.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to look at all options; they've done that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you going to put out his income tax?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \navailable. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will \nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \nthrough the questions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the \npresidential tax forms.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could we have one?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of \na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \nyour questions about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they file a joint form?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When did he file it?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \nMiyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \nmeeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No backgrounder today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \none day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of \nforce in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it \nout, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your \nthinking on whether or not to change your approach?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards \nBosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they \npeople whose opinions would carry weight with you?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight \ncertainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've \ninitiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \nalthough we're considering a number of options right now.  If the \nSerbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on \nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \nwhich we've been saying regularly.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them \nevery day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Which doesn't work so --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  \nWe're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we \nsupport the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on \nthe 26th.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us \nany documentation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to \nyou about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been no -- you have not been able to \nprovide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any \neffect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia \nand we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be \nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \nyou'd like.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't \nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \nprovide something along those lines?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced \nthis morning -- where is that money coming from?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the \ndetails of that package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So that would be new money that you would hope to \nget?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the \n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering \nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \nconcern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \nin the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit \nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to \nwork with Congress to make that happen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \nCongress?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \nthis process moves forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \nCongress?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \nCongress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs \npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \ngive kids something to do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who are they?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three \norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \nof Police Associations.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will the FBI chief be there?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \n$400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So this would be the $700 million that's in the \nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 \nmillion already in the budget.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or \nFiscal '94 --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact \nfunding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This $1.8 billion on top of --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 \nmillion Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob \nDole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was \ncalling Bob Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting \nwith Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some \nRepublicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \ncomplaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House \nand the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the \nother night, the satellite and all of this relationship.\nDoes the White House feel that you're getting too close to these \nChambers of Commerce?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  \nAfter how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any \nattention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of \nbeing too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled \nby the support we've received from the national Chamber and local \nChambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on \nthis and other initiatives.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the status of the President thinking about \ngoing to this Democratic retreat?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost \ncertainly go.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  All three days?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be \nthere yet.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it open to coverage?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, \nanything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't \nmade a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or \nwhat --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it \nout.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about an AIDS czar?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's coming.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Anything on the weekend?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this \nretreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear \nor have any involvement in the gay rights march.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been \ndiscussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic \nretreat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The weekend?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on \nright now is the radio address on Saturday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any travel plans?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He's not going to be off campaigning for his \nstimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely \nthat we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going \nto be focused on the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\n\n                                 END10:10 A.M.

Some restrict the term's meaning to \"active male\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\n\n                      *************************************\n\n                                   INTRODUCTION\n\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\n\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\nministry. \n\n\nFootnotes:\n_______________________\n 1.  For convenience sake, the term \"homosexual\" is used to encompass both\nsame-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  The meaning of this term is one of\nthe main considerations of this study.\n 2. These times are differnt from just over a century ago.  Then P Fairbairn\n(Pastoral Epistles [Edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it\nis a \"term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent.\" \nUnknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and\nstudy.  THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral\nEpistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see Donald Guthrie,\nNew Testament Introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive\ndiscussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship).\n 3. For example, see Scroggs' influence on M. Olson, \"Untangling the Web,\" The\nOther Side (April 1984): 24-29.  For a study suggesting a further prohibition\nof homosexuality in the OT, see A. Phillips, \"Unconvering the Father's Skirt,\"\nVT 30/1 (Jan, 1980) 38-43.  For a bibliography of other sources dealing with\narsenokoitai, see the Wisondisc Religion Indexes (NY: H. Wison Co., 1987).\n"}, {"text": "From: petere@tesla.mitre.org (Peter D.

Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\nOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \n\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  \n\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been \na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \n\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you \nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\n\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.\n\n>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\n>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\n>marginal.\n\n\tLemme ask you this.

Big deal.\n>Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so\n>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something\n\n\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\n80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\n\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\nstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\nSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.\n\n>isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When \n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential \n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\n\n\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.\n\tSkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\nabout Morris' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris' \"ability\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned \nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\n80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\nnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\n\"consideration\".  \n\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's \njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\n(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)\n\tPuck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \ntragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the\nleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.\n\n\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \nor not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

Perhaps they were \"strong in\nthe faith?\"\n\n---------------------------\n\n[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\nface after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\ndidn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\nceremonial aspects of it).\n\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\n\nHowever there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\nhave to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and\nhow that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\nPaul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.\n\n--clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nSubject: Armenian genocide of the Muslim people in 1914 and 1993.\nArticle-I.D.: zuma.9304052051\nReply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nDistribution: world\nLines: 52\n\nIn article <C51A38.MCJ@news.cso.uiuc.edu> ptg2351@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Panos Tamamidis ) writes:\n\n> Alah, alah, kleriklemek mutuglu diyeni de la malakismenos kolo-Tourkos ...\n> Likkleserfelc ekmek salam.

(BTW, sometimes it seems that our government \nis trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be\npainless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to\nhelp when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never\nget there without the aid.  It may be too late already.\n\n>\n>>BTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'
