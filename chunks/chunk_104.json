My\nmother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'\n(at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go\nto Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in\nIceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from\nmy homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to\nthe 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem\nwith the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare\nnot Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My\nwork for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism\nand racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices\nin Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based\non a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism\nfrom Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.\n\nThe Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities\nundertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command\nthe support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal\ninstitution and works with minimal funds.\n\nProfessionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published \nseveral pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.\n\nI would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in\na more civilized manner.

All they\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\nafter all IS the bottom line. \n\n\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \n\n\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\n\n\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \n\n\n\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\n\n\n\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\n\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\ndegree.\n\n\n\t\t\tSincerly,\n\n\t\t\tTim Scanlon\n\n-- \n\ntfs@gravity.gmu.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: paj@uk.co.gec-mrc (Paul Johnson)\nSubject: Re: History question\nReply-To: paj@uk.co.gec-mrc (Paul Johnson)\nOrganization: GEC-Marconi Research Centre, Great Baddow, UK\nLines: 25\n\nIn article <kazel.15.734728882@uiuc.edu> kazel@uiuc.edu (Mitch Kazel) writes:\n>Sorry if this isn't the correct news group . . . but . . .\n>\n>A colleague of mine is trying to find out when the first public use of \n>electronic voice amplification was  . . . i.e. a P-A system.\n>\n>Any reference would be appreciated.

MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the \nAttorney General?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.  I don't know \nthat he hasn't talked to her this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or \nanyone else?\n\t     \n\t     MS.

MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she \nanswered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of \nasking for the Attorney General's resignation.  He stands behind her \n100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He \ntakes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind \nAttorney General Reno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told \nthat he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much \nhe knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and \nthe justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of \nthat, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the \ncompound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else \nwas going to succeed, et cetera?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about \nthe decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led \nto her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision \nto go forward with it.  He was fully briefed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back \nnow, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision \nhe signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at \nwhat actually happened?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is \nlost.  But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the \ndecision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was \ninformed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 \npercent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the \nFBI.  It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone \non for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their \nlives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.  \n\t     \n\t     This was a very difficult situation and all the \ndecisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the \nground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving \nforward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the \nbest possible course of action.  There's just no point in second-\nguessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there's a reason --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?  They have to --\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I \nthink it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.  \nI think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at \nthis -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, \nit's not useful.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You sound like he's going to order an investigation \nof what happened and whether --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll have more to say about that \nlater, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He will order an investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to \nsay about an investigation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind of investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely \nthere is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right \ndecision.  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned \nout to be a rather -- a debacle.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review \nthe situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.  \nI don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But, \nagain, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and \nwe'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the FBI Director's role in this?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting \nup the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were \non the ground that were working with him.  I don't believe he spoke \nto the President, but I'll double-check that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of \nplanning and so forth?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what \naspects he was involved with.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House \ntoday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.  I don't believe \nthat she'll be here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on \non the part of political opposition to make something out of this in \nterms of -- to the President's detriment politically?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people \nwouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I \nthink, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate \nthe facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.  \nBut I think people understand that this was a difficult series of \ndecisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused \nby a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four \nfederal agents.   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent \n\f\nchildren lost their lives in this.  I don't think anybody disputes \nthe tragedy of the outcome.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling \nthe, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was \ntalking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at \nJustice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of \nthing?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end \nof the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the \nnews conference once there was a point at which there was enough \ninformation, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had \ntranspired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of \nlevels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department \nand at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening \nthere.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the \nPresident, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to \nanybody at the White House.  So who --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-\nstaff level.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department \nwas handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know, \nWebb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked \nto a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a \nnumber of different levels involved.  I don't want to get into \nexactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number \nof conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to \nkeep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its \nability as events unfolded throughout the day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  I don't know if he \ntalked -- he may have at one point.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And was the White House role just to seek \ninformation about what happened, or was it to direct the public \ninformation campaign that followed?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation \nso the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice \nDepartment managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very \ninterested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the \nPresident was following it very closely throughout the day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was \nfollowing it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet \nReno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her \nthis morning.  Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on \nthroughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.  \nHe's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning \nbefore events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written \nstatement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to \nher personally yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've \nspoken this morning.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung \nout to dry all day yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.  I think we said \nthroughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that \nhe stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be.  The President \nstands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts \nfull responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that \nJanet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they \ncould, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the \ntime.  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her \n1,000 percent.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One of the best indications of that is to pick up \nthe phone and tell her.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken \nthis morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why can't we find out?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I can't do it standing here \nright now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You've got six people here.  All they've got to do \nis pick up the phone.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered \nor he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to \nincreasing pressure on the Davidians?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.  \nAgain, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly \nshe told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it \nwas entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was \nhappening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he \ngave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was \nthat she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She \ninformed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I don't \nknow how much clearer we can be about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   Does okay mean --\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's \ngoing to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the \nadministration?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any \ncongressional investigation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the \nincidents that occurred yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully \nwith any congressional hearings that would be held?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.  \nOne that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had \na bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children \nmay have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either \nleft them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.  \nWhat do you know about those two --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts \nthis morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know \n-- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by \npeople who came out of the compound.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President received any report today in \nterms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've \nbeen able to find out on in the compound now?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.  I don't think that \nthey've gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it \nto cool off.  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported \nin the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney \nGeneral Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from \nthe so-called experts?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands \nbehind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of \nher advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he \nsupports that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about the validity of the decisions made on \nthe ground?  Does he back those --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions \nmade.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the \ndecision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the \nPresident says, I  made the decision.  But you're saying she made the \ndecision?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed \nabout the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility \nfor it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the \ndecision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated \nthe facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department \nand FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision \nand then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the \nchain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The \noperation went forward, and the President accepts full \nresponsibility.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to \ngo back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that \ncame through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or \nwith his involvement?  What was his involvement?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, you'd have to go to the Justice \nDepartment for the specific interaction between the Attorney General \nand the Director.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I don't know how many \ndifferent ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by \nthe Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney \nGeneral in this.  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, \nI want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who \nmade the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you \nknow, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The \nAttorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about \nthose decisions.  He okayed it.  He didn't raise any objections to \nit, and he accepts full responsibility.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have, based on what you know here at the \nWhite House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during \nthis --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Along those same lines, just in your initial review \nof the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come \nfrom not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having \nan FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?    \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do \nwith it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went \nforward.  I'm not going to speculate on that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet \nReno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to \nspeak to Clinton?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her \nresponsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I \nthink she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed \non the situation in Waco?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a \ndaily basis.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who briefed the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, \nwhat conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on \nthe events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a \nWhite House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House \nstaff on a number of issues.  Again, I'm not going to get into \nexactly who briefs him on what subjects.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Another subject?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On another subject.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Now we're going to do gays in the military.  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How close are you to signing the biodiversity \ntreaty?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech \non Earth Day tomorrow.  We'll have more to say about it then.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where \nyet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would \nyou characterize the speech tomorrow?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day \nspeech.  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past \npositions on these things.  But, again, I don't want to get too much \ninto what he's going to talk about tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On or off campus?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this at a location outside the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We \ndon't know exactly where yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President \ntalked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? \n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he'll \ntry to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today \n-- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, \nthat the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration \nstill believe that it can work and that they will sign on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of \npeaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the \nadministration is considering a wide variety of options at this \npoint.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of \nEastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with \nhis Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is that a question they're going to try to be \ndeciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they'll be reviewing a number of \noptions, including the peace plan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the group that he's meeting with today include \nReg Bartholomew?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.  But it will be \namong the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General \nPowell.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent \nencounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating \nthe no-fly zone?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't.  I'll get back to you on that.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will the President be meeting with every one of the \nleaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He will.  He'll be meeting, as you know, \nwith Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with \nthe rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  As a group, or one by one?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.  Now, Havel and \nWalesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for \nquite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of \nstate that are here.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he \nsupports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been \nworked out for him to address the march on Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some \nkind of a statement to the march.  We haven't worked out the exact \ndetails of that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Not a live phone hook-up?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting \nto Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to \nthe other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on \nit.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you know what it's on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll still working out --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam.  \nWhen will he be meeting with the President?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  We'll \ntalk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report, \nbut exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So he's not going to come immediately to the White \nHouse?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Drug czar?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you expect it before the march?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the \nLloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.\n\f\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on \namendments today.  We'll continue to talk.  The President is \ncommitted to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.  \nAnd we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where \nwe end up.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When this briefing is over can you give us word \nthrough the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to \nJanet Reno?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's become a pressing question for the last \nseveral hours.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that I've been here, \nand I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered \na compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that's the \nbest alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a \nsecond look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that \ntoday, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the \nMitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that \nwill be at the march on Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the \nPresident.  I don't know who yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, has it been decided how he's going to \naddress?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but \nthere hasn't been a final decision on that yet.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The official will read the letter, is that what it \nsounds like?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you \nknow what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.  It may have come \nup, but it was about economic issues.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the \ntarget?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress \nspeech at the end of May --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven't resolved exactly how the \nPresident will present the health care plan to the people.  I \nwouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.\n\n                                 END10:08 A.M. EDT\n\n"}, {"text": "From: denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu\nSubject: REVISED TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF CLIPPER CHIP\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Georgetown University\nLines: 167\n\nHere is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors\nand provides some additional information and explanation.\n\n\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\n\n                               Dorothy Denning\n\n                           Revised, April 21, 1993\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\n\n\nCHIP CONTENTS\n\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\nencryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\n\nEach chip includes the following components:\n\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\n\nThe chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the\n\"MYK-78.\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are\nimplemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about\n$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the\ntechnology is shrunk to .8 micron.\n\n\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\n\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\nvalues:\n\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \n\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\n\nThe ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the\nsession key:\n\n   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .\n\n\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\nInformation Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\nMykotronx.\n\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\n80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\n80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\nkeys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\nfunction of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\n  \nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\n64-bit block R1:\n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \n\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\n\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\nagencies.\n\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing\nan 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not\nknow the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit\nkey parts.  \n\nThe third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are\nprogrammed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents\nleave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no\ninformation is left behind.\n \nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\nthe escrow agencies. \n\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\nboth may be independent from the government.\n\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\n\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the\nClipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the\nfamily key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap\nhas been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is\nthen sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who\nreturn (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed\ntogether to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the\nsession key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will\nbe accomplished through a special black box decoder.\n\n\nCAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION\n\nA successor to the Clipper Chip, called \"Capstone\" by the government\nand \"MYK-80\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include\nthe Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the\nSecure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast\nexponentiator, and a randomizer.

And, much as it discomforts us, in\nhumans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and\ncranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.\nDomestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:\nmy family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-\ngrandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife\nhad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-\ngrandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous\nfarmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of\nchildbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,\ncontain quite a few gravestones like \"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and\nbaby, May 6, 1853.\"\n\n>You wanted\n>to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a\n>thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage,\n\nMore like one in ten.

But it is often fatal, when it happens out of\nreach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.\n\nClearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine\ndesign); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.  \n\n>You have your kids where you want. You encourage your wife to\n>get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles, expose herself\n>to anesthesia and infection, and whatever other \"just in case\" measures\n>you think are necessary.\n\nMy, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack\nin months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.\n\nWe're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although\nI can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked\nthem up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.\nI wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly\nindicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting\nuntil an emergency to give in.\n\nAnd bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.\nWe talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main\ndecisions were really hers.\n\n>But I for one am bothered by your continued\n>suggestions, especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first\n>time, that birth is dangerous, even fatal, and that all these\n>unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing\n>it naturally.\n\nI don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that\na first-time mother should have her baby at home.\n\n>I'm no Luddite.

Should they\nfail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their \nchildren, the parent would be held responsible\n-- not for their children's sins, but for not\nteaching them properly.\n\nWhenever the Lord installs someone to a position \nof authority in either the family or the church He\nexpects that person to teach those in his charge.\n\nIn Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others \nis likened to \"a watchman unto the house of Israel.\"\n\"If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from \nhis way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but\nhis blood will I require at thine hand.\nNevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to \nturn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he\nshall die in his iniquity; but thou hast\ndelivered thy soul.\"\n\nEven though the D&C prefaces this commandment with\n\"parents have children in Zion\" I believe all\nparents are responsible for teaching their children \nwhatever good principles they understand.\nHowever, LDS parents accept greater responsbility\nand could be judged more strictly.\n\nA IDLER\n"}, {"text": "From: naccarat@eclipse.sheridanc.on.ca (Rob Naccarato)\nSubject: Somebody please help me!\nNntp-Posting-Host: eclipse.sheridanc.on.ca\nOrganization: Sheridan College, Ontario, Canada\nLines: 15\n\n  Hello, I hope this is the right group to post this in.\n  I've got a little problem.

This probably tells you something >> about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME\n>> of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have \n>> to say?\n\nI used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect\nEnglish constructs such as \"its raining\" or \"it's window id\" annoy me.\nHowever, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way\nthings really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS\nwas really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically\nsuperior as well!).\n\nOn a related topic, who is to say that \"color\" is more or less correct\nthan \"colour\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed\nto American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API\nterms such as \"XAllocColor\" and \"colormap\".\n\nIn a world that uses the term \"Windows\" to refer to Microsoft Windows,\nperhaps the time has come to accept \"X Windows\" as a valid term for X.\nI think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,\n\"the X Window System\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it.\nUltimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate\npeople. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,\nsnappy, descriptive title (\"X\" is positively obscure) will help\nwhen dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a\nsoftware engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become\npopularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should\nbe called \"Microsoft Windows\" or \"the Microsoft Window System\" or\nhow about just plain \"Microsoft\"!\n\nTo summarise (or should that be \"summarize\") the point of this message:\nI think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than\nworrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system\n(or should that be \"windowing system\"). Whatever gets recognised is\nfine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what\ntrade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this\nconclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.\n\n\n\t\t\tGerard O'Driscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk)\n\t\t\tDu Pont Pixel Systems Ltd.\n"}, {"text": "From: lwb@cs.utexas.edu (Lance W.
