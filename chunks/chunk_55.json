This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\" when\nyou've heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\n\"therefore\".\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God.\"\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\n\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\nB\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\n\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. \nIf the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=>B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent's particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent's argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou're white.\"\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\n\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred.\"\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me\nguilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\n\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\nand\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer\"\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists.\"\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere.\"\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache.\"\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons.\"\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice.\"\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\nor\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\nand\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight.\"\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana.\"\n\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of\nhistory?\"\n\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a\nform of Christianity?\"\n\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\"\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because \"that's the way it's always been.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\n\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n\"You're just being randomly abusive.\"\n\"So?  You've been abusive too.\"\n\n\u00ff\n"}, {"text": "From: sp1marse@kristin (Marco Seirio)\nSubject: Flat globe\nLines: 13\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL3\n\n\nDoes anybody have an algorithm for \"flattening\" out a globe, or any other\nparametric surface, that is definied parametrically. \nThat is, I would like to take a sheet of paper and a knife and to be\nable to calculate how I must cut in the paper so I can fold it to a\nglobe (or any other object).\n\n\n      Marco Seirio - In real life sp1marse@caligula.his.se\n\n \n\n \n"}, {"text": "From: scott@asd.com (Scott Barman)\nSubject: Re: BaseballIsDead\nOrganization: American Software Development Corp., West Babylon, NY\nLines: 29\n\nIn article <1993Apr8.195853.10650@midway.uchicago.edu> as16@midway.uchicago.edu writes:\n>My question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the\n>death of baseball so strongly?

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\nbehind it.  What's going on here?\n\nLet's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\nI'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\nbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\n\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\nhim over the edge.\n\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\n\nLet's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\n\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\nshow the world how big her balls are.\n\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim\n1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of\nthe Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th\ncommandments and in the midst of this listing is \"homosexuals.\"  The decalogue,\nabove everything else, is seen as God's absolute.  If you don't believe in\nabsolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul\nreveals to be the Messiah of the NT. \"Lord Christ Jesus\" transliterates to read\n\"Jehovah's Anointed Savior.\"  \n  In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan\ngentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)\nis not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew\nfull well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for\napplication in the NT.  As I've said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away\nwith.\n\n>>of questions we are trying to deal with.

Please refer to it.\n\n>\n>One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\n>is because Paul probably did face this and other problems. \n\nWe can do better than \"probably\" which is not an adequate defense against the\nstatement that Paul's culture didn't have the same understanding of\nhomosexuality as ours.  \nAgain read the article because it uses facts.\n\n>>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\n>>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.\n>\n>I don't see how you come to that conclusion.\n\nI think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of\nworking with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application\nof the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of\nhomosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who\nis contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,\nyet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is\nno remorse, then I feel that Paul's \"pastoral\" care, as presented in the\nCorinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion\nshould be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,\nthen one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member\nin your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn't\nhesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays\nthe present \"political correctness\" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at\nthe present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is\npolitically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how\nthe morals decay.  \n\nI guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of\neconomics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own\nstates, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax\nincentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of\nrelativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment.\n--Rex\n\n[You might want to look over 1 Tim 1:10 again.  If this is really the\n5th through 9th commandments, we seem to be missing thieves, and\nhomosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery.  This is of course\npossible if \"arsenokoitia\" has a narrower meaning than homosexuality\nin general, but I think that's not your thesis.  I have no objection\nper se to the idea that the author of 1 Tim might have quoted the 10\ncommandments, but 5 through 9, minus one and plus a few things, begins\nto look a bit marginal.  --clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

Steve just took issue with David's\ncharacterization of my words as \"pernicious nonsense.\"\n\nI won't further comment on my own views...folks either support 'em or\nthey don't, and the lines in question were neither central to the\npoints I was making in my original post nor to the important debate\nhere in sci.crypt and elsewhere.\n\n\n-Tim May, who continues to hold the same views but doesn't feel like\ndebating politics\n\n-- \n..........................................................................\nTimothy C.

Bussard, Journal of\n\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand.

In the event of a total\nhard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data\nfrom the backups I keep of that.

Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope),\nbut then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS\ninformation is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS\nmanufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the\nmotherboard.

If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be\nreinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is \"this\nsoftware has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to\ninstall it on other machines.\"  Or something similar; Access for Windows\ndoes this and it only requires a click on \"OK\" to go away.

The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,\nFourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.\nThe existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the\namendment.

Remember that our \"system\"\nis only an insurance policy.  But our costs aren't rising fast\nenough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year,\nQuebec's user-fee proposal came out with the number of \"$5\" as\nthe necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather\nthan give the QMA a raise.

If provincial governments (as bad as some of them\nare; heck, we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the\nConservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing!) can be so irresponsible,\nthere is still reallocation --- health insurance is so important that\nit's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent\ninsurrection outside of the hockey rink.

The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\n\n\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\n\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\n\t  brings the death penalty.  \n\n\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?\n\n\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\n\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\n\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\n\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\n\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\n\t  prostitutes.\n\n\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've\n\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\n\t  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.\n\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\n\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \n\n\t  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,\n\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\n\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\n\n\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\n\n\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\n\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\nlast six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).

So the\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\nSaud, like they're trying to in the long run.\n\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\nwant, Ilyess?\n\n--\nDave Bakken\n==>\"the President is doing a fine job, but the problem is we don't know what\n    to do with her husband.\" James Carville (Clinton campaign strategist),2/93\n==>\"Oh, please call Daddy.

They\ninclude the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the\nfact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the\nhistorical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.\n\n\tWhen Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,\nthe cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit\nreligious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,\nwho did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The\nJordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a\nJewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their\nlatrines.\n\n\tIsrael has allowed individuals of all religions into\nJerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to\ncontrol the city.\n\n\tAlso, I should point out that Islam is not centered in\nJerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,\nwhere all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,\nnor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\n\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\nI made was driving from New York to Texas.

No problems.\n\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80.

Normal {asynchronous}\n SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these\n modes is mainly in the software drivers.\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. \n Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for\n a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.\n 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using\n SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which\n results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit\n and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software\n drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI\n interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term\n 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},\n 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\n {32-bit}.\n\n8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 \nthat I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software\ncontrolers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds\nfor SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT\nNEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit\nSCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1\nelectornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider\n16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but\n4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1\nbut is 8-bit SCSI-2.\nRule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.\n\n8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost\ncompared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.\n"}, {"text": "From: jrwaters@eos.ncsu.edu (JACK ROGERS WATERS)\nSubject: Re: GOT MY BIKE!

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\nare challenging?\n     \"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\" announced\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to\nwin.\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\nRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\n     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\nfirst in this wacky season.\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\nThe Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\nRogers 3-2.  \"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don't see why we can't win this\ndivision.\"\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\npitcher's park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\npitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't\nafford to let the Astros beat us.\"  He then winked and said: \"Well, maybe\nDavis will get decked once.\"\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\nthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It's as if some three-year-old threw a\ntantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit\nhome runs',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\nAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\n     \"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\n     \"We're mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\nplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\nguess that's why they're so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\n     Standings after these weekend series:\nA.L.East\nTeam                     W           L           GB\nNew York                68        42          --\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\nDetroit                 64        46           4\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\nWashington              39         73          28\n\nA.L.West\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\nMinnesota               61         48            1\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\nCalifornia              57         56            8\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\n\nN.L.East\nChicago          57         53                --\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\nNew York         48         64               10\n\nN.L.West\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\nHouston          50          61               17.5\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5\n-- \nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a great\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\n"}, {"text": "From: ak296@yfn.ysu.edu (John R.

The most recent\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\npolice.\"2\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\n \n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\n1986\n-------\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

Note that since\n|>these moves were made by free willed human beings, not \"settlers,\" I\n|>will address two aspects of your question, why the government would\n|>allow &/or encourage them to move, and second why they did move.\n\nThey were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return\nof the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the\nPrince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud\nbeleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous\npopulation.\n\nThe pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the \nredefinition of much land used in common as \"public land\". The assertion\nthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to\nan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an\nexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought\nin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the\nGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories\nmust not be changed. \n\nNo amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists\nwill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of\nthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.\n\n\n|>\tThe government had a number of reasons for encouraging people\n|>to move across the green line.  They included security and politics.\n|>\n|>\tThe first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makes\n|>it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements also\n|>act as fortresses in times of war.\n\nTheyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that\nwould last no more than hours against tanks,\n\n|>\tA second reason was political.  Creating \"settlements\" brought\n|>the arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns and\n|>cities gone on another several years, there would be no place left in\n|>Israel where there was an arab majority.  There would have been no\n|>land left that could be called arab.\n\nDon't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the\nnegotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf\nthey insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.\n\nIf the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have\ncut the money supply.\n\n|>\tThe fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place\n|>changes the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land can\n|>be given away.\n\nNot at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.\n\n|>\tSome of the communites created were religious.  They built\n|>their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of\n|>the 30's and 40's.  There are communities like this in Hebron, Gaza,\n|>and all over.  There are also communities built near religious sites.\n\nThe existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country\nto annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.\n\n|>\tThe point is, there are many reasons people moved over the\n|>green line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whatever\n|>status is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an \"all\n|>or nothing\" deal.  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation, not\n|>be the results of a war.\n\nUnless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.\nAraffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.\n\n\nThe real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the\nPalestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it\nis this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the\nreturn of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the\ndismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against\nnon-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. \n\nThe irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has\na non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the\nIsraeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean\noutlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying\nor using much of the land. \n\n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker \n"}, {"text": "From: hays@ssd.intel.com (Kirk Hays)\nSubject: Re: Gov't break-ins (Re: 60 minutes)\nNntp-Posting-Host: taos\nOrganization: Intel Supercomputer Systems Division\nLines: 23\n\nIn article <1993Apr5.155733.114@pasadena-dc.bofa.com>, franceschi@pasadena-dc.bofa.com writes:\n|> On a Los Angeles radio station last weekend, the lawyers for the\n|> family of the MURDERED rancher said that the Los Angeles Sheriff's\n|> Department had an assessment done of the rancher's property before\n|> the raid.\n\nThe briefing documents for the raid had a notation on them about a\nsimilar local property which had sold for $800,000 prior to the\nraid, if recent TV coverage can be believed.\n\n|> This strongly implies that the sheriff's department wanted the property;\n|> any drugs (which were not found) were only an excuse.\n\nThe Ventura County DA came to the same conclusion in the report he\nreleased, which lambasted the Sheriff's Office.\n\nToo bad the old man was nearly blind, and didn't take a few\ngoose-stepping Drug Warriors (TM) with him.\n\n-- \nKirk Hays - NRA Life, seventh generation.\n\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to\ndo nothing.\"  -- Edmund Burke (1729-1797)\n"}, {"text": "From:  (Sean Garrison)\nSubject: Re: Bonilla\nNntp-Posting-Host: berkeley-kstar-node.net.yale.edu\nOrganization: Yale Univeristy\nLines: 37\n\nIn article <1993Apr17.213553.2181@organpipe.uug.arizona.edu>,\nkrueger@helium.gas.uug.arizona.edu (theodore r krueger) wrote:\n \n> Isn't it funny that  a white person calls comeone a \"nigger\" and gets banned \n> for a year, but a black person calls someone a \"faggot\" and there is no \n> consequence?\n\n> Ted\n\n\nTed, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.

Some of the information in the posting requires some\nclarification, and I would like to answer some of the questions\nraised on sci.crypt.\n     SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland.  Our\ntwo main products at this time are a PC based secure\ncommunications program called SECOM and a general purpose\nencryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM.\n     SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link\nbetween two PC's connected over dial up telephone lines.  It\nsupports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard\nto screen \"chat\".  It has its own proprietary communications\nprotocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption.  All\nthough it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to be\ncontinuous because the packet boundaries are hidden.\n     When SECOM was initially developed, it was implemented to\nuse DES encryption.  A business decision was made to seek export\napproval for the product because it was perceived that the\noverseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing\nopportunity.\n     We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general\nexport approval for anything using DES.  All though the reason\nfor this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have something\nto do with secret government to government agreements which are\nstill in effect.\n     In any event, the decision was made to develop a new and\ndifferent algorithm which would take the place of DES.  This was\nthe reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born.\n     At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret.  The\npreliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is to\nmake it public once the patent process is complete.  All though\none can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing\nsecret, I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is\nnecessary to let people \"shoot at it\" over an extended period of\ntime to prove its worth.\n     In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA, it was\nnecessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of\nthe program and algorithm.  This was done only AFTER we had a\nfinished product to submit.\n     Let me state unequivocally that there is NO \"back door\" to\nthe program or the algorithm.  Secured Communications\nTechnologies is a closely held private company and\nNSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way\nwhatsoever with the company or any of the people involved.\n     From a practical business standpoint, we are interested in\nselling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a\nback door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy our\ncredibility and our business.\n     With the encryption algorithm approved for export, we set\nout to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption\nproducts and systems.  We were able to identify several common\nthreads of functionality requirements.  This led to the design of\na chip with the encryption algorithm \"cast in silicon\" and\ncertain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill\nthe broad range of requirements that we identified.\n     We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips.  In a\npress release today, our president, Dr. Stephen Bryen stated:\n\n          \"It seems as if the government has an unlimited source\n     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American\n     Public.  But do we not understand how the National Security\n     Agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic\n     spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip\n     intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying\n     activities.\"\n\n     If they had asked me to put a \"back door\" in NEA I would\nhave told them to g__ f____ed.\n     Can NSA break NEA?  Or for that matter can they break DES,\nRSA, IDEA, Diffy-Hellman, PGP, RC2, RC4, or whatever?

If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must \ngenerate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local osc\nfrequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  \nThe detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Since\nthe AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...\nI think you get the picture.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nSubject: Re: Europe vs. Muslim Bosnians\nReply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)\nDistribution: world\nLines: 76\n\nIn article <C6x81M.EJF@news.cis.umn.edu> prabhak@giga.cs.umn.edu (Satya Prabhakar) writes:\n\n>Actually, this strife in Yugoslavia goes back a long way.

Or is it your \ninterpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment \nof your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In \nany case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts:\n\n\nSource: Walker, Christopher: \"Armenia: The Survival of a Nation.\"\n        New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.\n\nThis generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information\nof direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: \n\na) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the \narchitect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected \nof Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic \nin Berlin during World War II; \n\nb) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social \ntheories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members \nof the Aryan 'Super-Race;' \n\nc) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves \nwith the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, \n\nd) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side \nby side with the Wehrmacht.\n\n \nIn fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast \nnetwork of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. \nThousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in \nRussia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and \nfifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. \nThey were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in \nan agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of \nthis agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, \n1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians \nwere aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed \npro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.\n\n\nIn 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi\nconcentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first\nArmenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion \nhad grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro \n(the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the \narchitect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds \nbetween 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious \nDashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged \nby this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\n\nSerdar Argic\n\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \n                            a single Turkish soul.'
