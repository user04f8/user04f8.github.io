The New York Football Giants\nhad moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was\nhaving problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee\nStadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea.\nWhen a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the\nnew AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using\nthe new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the\nCosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into\nthe World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to\npromote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing\nwith the Mets).

I guessed this would be  a basic condition\n      for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)\n\nThe US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers,\nthey're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services\noperated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records.\nAs Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,\nyou have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,\nand they generally can confiscate the equipment as \"evidence\"\n(which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to\ndevelop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel\nyou to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password\nfor the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new\nsituation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it.\nBut the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no\nlaws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys\nfor their own files without giving them to you.\n\nEven in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty.\nThere was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records\nsubpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,\nso he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew.\nThe US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English,\nand these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew,\nand neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think they\nwere able to do much about it.\n\nIt might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers\nbased on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference;\nit probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible\nextension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.\n\n\n--\n#\t\t\t\tPray for peace;      Bill\n# Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ\n#\t              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....\n# White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461\n"}, {"text": "From: mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer)\nSubject: Re: Bases loaded walk gives Reds win in 12: RedReport 4-21\nOrganization: Netcom Online Communications Services (408-241-9760 login: guest)\nLines: 50\n\nIn article <GRABINER.93Apr23115329@germain.harvard.edu> grabiner@math.harvard.edu (David Grabiner) writes:\n>In article <mssC5w795.7G4@netcom.com>, Mark Singer writes:\n>\n>Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to\n>pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch\n>hitter in the past.\n>\n>But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.\n>Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?

But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\n|> serves no other purpose ?\n\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\n\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\n\n\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were\n|> 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\n|> Transjordan (Jordan).

Having all the above facts in mind, one\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\n\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.\n\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\nand sensible.\n\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\n|> official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\n|> Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\n|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\n\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\nAs to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\nhas.\n\n|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\n|> 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\n|> Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\n|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\n\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\n\n|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\n|> way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'.

This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\n\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\n\nMy answers were not any more \"hysterical\" than the questions\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative,\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\nfall into the same category of those who seek \"yes\" \"no\" answers\nwhen the real answer is \"of sorts\".\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\nthem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look\nYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated\nculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they\nhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment\nthey sought to protect.

This is\nNOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist\nby default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the\ngovernment from removing that right by stating very clearly the government\nshall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.

Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary.\"\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] \"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] \"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion.\"\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

This disables the auto-answer \nfunction of the modem for FirstClass.

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn't spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.

They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

Asante EN/SC\nadapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the\nnewest drivers from Asante's ftp server.\n\nThe problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -\nspecifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the \"happy Mac face\" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this?

And \ntoday, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other \nnation had ever known in history.\n                               \n\nSource: The Times, 2 March 1992\n\nCORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH\n\nANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES \nTO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...\n\nAs we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw \nthe scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \nof the hills.\n\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \nor missing... \n\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\n\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \nrepeated blasts.\n\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\n\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains \nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\n\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\n\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\n\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \nmortis. They had been shot.\n\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh?

In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.

I am on an\ninformation gathering venture regarding the various expressions of\nChristianity/churches there are.  \n        My husband and I come from very different, but completely\nChristian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a\nborn and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot\nof what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical\nbased Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.\nHowever over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the\nChurch of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a\nfundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are\nsocio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine.\nOne of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through\nMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but\nin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I\nam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser\nmember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that\nverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in\nanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men\n(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw\nwas when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college\ngroups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the\nstudy.\nAlso my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church\nfeels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL\nChristian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call\nthemselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to\nlong prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are\nalso don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new \"movement\" being\nled by the young people.\n\nSo, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably\nbiblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter\nwhat their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).\nChristopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious\nconvictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still\nbring their Bibles to service.\n\nWe are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a\nplace where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and\nwithout reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be\nthrilled!\nI'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and\neven harder for me to stay churchless for long.\n\nany responses would be welcome\n\n\nthe diel family\n\n[I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what\nyou're looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of the\nflavor of the specific local churches in your area than the\ndenomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sort\nof narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum.\nHistorically that's been associated with movements that have the\ncharacter you're trying to avoid.  --clh]\n"}, {"text": "Subject: insurance question\nFrom: <LIBEMC@BYUVM.BITNET>\nOrganization: Brigham Young University\nLines: 18\n\nI'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it.

This was the age of\n  nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with\n  the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on\n  the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul\n  and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be\n  the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement,\n  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the\n  efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the\n  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so\n  much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which\n  dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious\n  independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the\n  Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent\n  aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>\n\n  page 188:\n\n  <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their\n   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular\n   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian\n   missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and\n   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as\n   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.\n\n   Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,\n   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews\n   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.\n   Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving\n   large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,\n   by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects\n   who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim\n   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent\n   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive\n   and damaging.\n\n   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting\n   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian\n   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout\n   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary\n   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>\n\n  page 188:\n\n  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,\n   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and\n   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking\n   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which\n   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries\n   earlier.\n\n   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth\n   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united\n   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth\n   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its\n   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When\n   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian\n   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre\n   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>\n\n  page 189:\n\n  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the\n  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from\n  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and\n  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through\n  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>\n\n  page 190 (second paragraph):\n\n  <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population\n   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal\n   property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews\n   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to\n   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>\n\n  page 190 (third paragraph):\n\n  <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly\n   because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist\n   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia\n   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by\n   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During\n   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred\n   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about\n   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were\n   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,\n   after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled\n   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac\n   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the\n   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the\n   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial\n   superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of\n   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of\n   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].\n   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled\n   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity\n   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into\n   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before\n   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression\n   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities\n   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years\n   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the\n   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the\n   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately\n   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary\n   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying\n   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of\n   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats\n   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman\n   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,\n   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the\n   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their\n   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th\n   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews\n   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu\n   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands\n   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and\n   Izmir [21].>>\n\n   page 193 (last paragraph):\n\n   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing\n   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe\n   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all\n   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being\n   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as\n   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and\n   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian\n   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,\n   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the\n   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally\n   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their\n   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors\n   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements\n   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done\n   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the\n   twentieth century.>>\n\n  page 194 (last paragraph):\n\n  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the\n   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the\n   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due\n   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of\n   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a\n   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of\n   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,\n   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms\n   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods\n   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from\n   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.\n\n   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian\n   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,\n   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,\n   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus\n   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically\n   described the situation caused by the invading armies:\n\n      'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,\n      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never\n      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the\n      entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can\n      never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the\n      damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done\n      to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government\n      weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors\n      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The\n      consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of\n      them were massacred in a single night....'[28]\n\n     'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and\n      burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high\n      civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of\n      6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned.

Post it only\nif you think it of general interest.\n\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\nfind it relevant.\n\nA listmember asks:\n\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\n\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\n\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\n\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\ntogether.\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.\n      She says: What are you talking about?\n      He says: I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and\nyounger.\n      She says: But you can't. We are married!\n      He says: What are you talking about? We never got married.\n      She says: I remember distinctly what you said to me the night\nwe first made love. You said: \"My love for you is as deep as the\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\n      He says: Oh that! That was just rhetoric. Just poetry. When a\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\nthings like that. You mustn't take them literally.\n\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\na matter of public record.\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\nor just \"poetry.\"\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\n\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\nthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\nand \"till death do us part.\"\n\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\nthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\nother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\nout on? \" The original questioner said: \"Good grief, I never thought\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\nsomeone who says, \"We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\nbother.\n\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\ncommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\nus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\n\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n"}, {"text": "From: drt@athena.mit.edu (David R Tucker)\nSubject: Re: Question: Jesus alone, Oneness\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLines: 52\n\nIn article <Apr.21.03.26.22.1993.1355@geneva.rutgers.edu>,\nBjorn.B.Larsen@delab.sintef.no (A 369) writes:\n|> Can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there\n|> is only Jesus?
