[{"text": "From: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu (Ed Stastny)\nSubject: The OTIS Project (FTP sites for original art and images)\nKeywords: Mr.Owl, how many licks...\nOrganization: University of Nebraska at Omaha\nLines: 227\n\n\n\t-------------------------------------\n\t+ ............The OTIS Project '93  +      \n\t+ \"The Operative Term Is STIMULATE\" + \n\t-------------------------------------\n\t---this file last updated..4-21-93---\n\n\nWHAT IS OTIS?\n\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \nand distribution.  Digital immortality.\n\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \n \nIf that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will \ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\n \nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\ncopies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...\nthat's what they're here for.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE?             \n\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \n \n \t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\n\t\t\n\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \n\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\n\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\nappropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\ncommand to make sure you're in binary.\n\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\nOTIStuff...\n\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\n\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\n              \nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\ncopies to:\n\nThe OTIS Project\nc/o Ed Stastny\nPO BX 241113\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\n\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we'll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you'd like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat's about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\nYour input is expected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \n \t     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,\n\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\n\t     however.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \n \t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \n\t     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\n\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \n    \t     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS\n\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\n\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \n\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \n\t     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     \n\t     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\n\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\n\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \n\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \n\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\n\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".  If you know of people\nthat'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm\nin the booty....offer them free food...whatever...\n\n....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)\n       (ed@sunsite.unc.edu)\n\n--\nEd Stastny           | OTIS Project, END PROCESS, SOUND News and Arts \nPO BX 241113\t     | FTP: sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS)\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113 |      141.214.4.135 (projects/otis)\n---------------------- EMail: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu, ed@sunsite.unc.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: gemmellj@merrimack.edu\nSubject: e-mail to the hill ??\nOrganization: Merrimack College, No. Andover, MA, USA\nLines: 4\n\nNow, that Clinton can get e-mail, i'm wondering if Congress is also\ngoing on line..

In fact, I  don't  remember\n_ever_ crashing.\n\nOf course, I really don't run any  OS/2 programs, just the  same bunch\nof DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running.\n\nAnd  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running\nDos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a\ntendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from\nparticularly fast  clients  (DTR's  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the\nproblem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write\nbuffer, everything would work fine.\n\nFTP under OS/2 has never locked,  though.  I can even format  floppies\n(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.)\n\n>\tFor instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed\n>\tWP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.\n\nYeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2  is somewhat sensitive to\nspecific hardware.

It\nwas a pleasure to read them.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nYou are welcome, Zane.\n \nZane...\n\"I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I\nwould like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.\nI mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you\nhave read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain that\nwill result in your Christian life?\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith\n    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound\n    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I\n    could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.\n    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine (and they\n    still send it to me), and also Copeland's (also, still sent to me).\n    It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:\n    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were\n    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying\n    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my\n    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that\n    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in\n    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!\n \n(2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith \"cult\" in my area - it's\n    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into\n    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and\n    has now fallen into atheism.  I'm still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).\n \n(3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been\n    a `follower' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the\n    Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers'\n    heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I've been able to talk\n    to him at length about these issues.\n \n(4) The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan'.\n    Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to\n    women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as\n    my lending CIC to people in the church.\n \nI'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and\nhave an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.\nWhat heresies?\n    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became\n        one with him.\n    B. Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone.\n    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by\n        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling\n        over Him there.\n    D. Jesus was `born-again' in hell.\n    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after\n        the resurrection.\n    F. We are gods.\n \nThese are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings\nupon request.\n \nZane...\n\"Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out and\njoining up with the word/faith movement which you'd been contemplating\njoining for so long, but now that you've read the book, you've been saved\nfrom all of that?\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nIt wasn't _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet by\nSwaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendous\ndocumentation and insights.\n \nZane...\n\"I don't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un-\nprofitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nWhy do you call it \"heresy hunting\"?  \"Hunting\" implies it isn't readily\naccessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in\nChristendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has sold\nmore books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  Fred\nPrice has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn't\nsound like much \"hunting\" is needed.\n \nIt is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before.\nMore can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal,\npractical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to expose\nerror and heresy.  It's not a new thing.  Remember Luther?\n \nZane...\n\"I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt heretics\noften end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un-\ndocumented opinion.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n(1) If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated.\n(2) Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes\n    disunity and immaturity in the body.\n \nEPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of\nthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness\nof Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried\nabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning\ncraftiness of deceitful plotting....\n \nDisunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it's\ncaused by error.\n \nZane...\n\"There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as\ndocumenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I would\nsuggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and\nmatures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nMost scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Let's examine his admonitions\nto Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become...\n \n2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,\nin faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was\ncommitted to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, that\nall those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and\nHermogenes.\n \n2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does\nnot need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane\nand idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their\nmessage will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who\nhave strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already\npast; and they overthrow the faith of some.\n \n2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,\nable to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if\nGod perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and\nthat they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having\nbeen taken captive by him to do his will.\n \n2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make\ncaptives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,\nalways learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as\nJannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of\ncorrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no\nfurther, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.\n \n2TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer\npersecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving\nand being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned\nand been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from\nchildhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise\nfor salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by\ninspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for\ncorrection, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be\ncomplete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.\n \n2TI 4:2-5 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince,\nrebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come\nwhen they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires,\nbecause they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and\nthey will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.\nBut you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an\nevangelist, fulfill your ministry.\n \n2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm.

Therefore, if I come, I will call\nto mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And\nnot content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids\nthose who wish to, putting them out of the church.\n \nJesus also singled out teachings and doctrines...\n \nREV 2:14-16 \"But I have a few things against you, because you have there those\nwho hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block\nbefore the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit\nsexual immorality. \"Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the\nNicolaitans, which thing I hate.

Unfortunately, heresy is being\ntaught not just in Copeland's church or Hagin's or Hinn's or Price's, but all\nover the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materials\nthe sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It's imperative that leadership\nbe made aware of this, and CIC does just that.\n \nAlso, let's examine a passage of Scripture...\n* EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some\nevangelists, and some pastors and teachers,\n* EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the\nedifying of the body of Christ,\n \nThese ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one\nindividual church, but for \"the body of Christ\".\nPaul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was also\na teacher -\n1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and\nfaithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach\neverywhere in every church.\n1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each\none, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.\n \nAlso -\n1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second\nprophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,\nadministrations, varieties of tongues.\n \n* EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of\nthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness\nof Christ;\n \nNotice that the \"Five-Fold\" ministries are going to be around \"till\" the church\nis in \"unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect\nman\".  This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see\n1Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hinders\nmaturity and unity of the body?\n \n* EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried\nabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning\ncraftiness of deceitful plotting,\n \nIt's clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church \"by the trickery of\nmen\" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritual\nimmaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are\n\"tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine\".\n \nThe \"Five -Fold\" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clear\nScriptural denominational boundaries (\"pastors\" appear responsible for their\nindividual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their\nstruggle to equip the body.\n \nAll believers are called to do this to a degree...\nJUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our\ncommon salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend\nearnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. For\ncertain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this\ncondemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny\nthe only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.\n \nZane...\n\"If you'll notice, in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church to\nChurch and area to area, were the \"bad guys\" and they went after the \"good guy\"\nnamely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\nThey were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preaching\ncontrary to what they taught!\n \nZane...\n\"Let's face it, the wolves are here for a reason.

In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\n\nThis doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?\"\n\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\nit is not.\n\n\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\nJohn E King:\n\n> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the\n> area[.]\n\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\nbe rebuilt\", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\nto get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\npopulation' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\n\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\n\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\nit is hardly a `clear implication'.\n\n\nMr King also writes:\n\n> So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\n> Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\n> we are talking about a one-horse town.\n\nWell, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\nit's at least a two-horse town.\n\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it's still 22,000 people\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\n\n\nAnd you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\n\nLet's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\n\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\n\n *\n\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\n\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\n\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\nwalls.\n\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\"[Do] You know why I'm the enabler?

Without delving into a deep discussion of\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\n\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\nof this statement, shouldn't we?\n\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\n\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \n\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \n\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \nTry Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\n& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\n\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\n: scientific perspective, just different.\n\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\n \n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\n: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\n\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\n\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\nmore important than we've thought - for instance, sex might\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \n \n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\n\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \n\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\n\nI'd replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\nevolve.\n\nI'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \n\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \n\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \n\nI can understand Scott's reaction:\n\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\n: > jesting.

Do you have evidence against\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\nand not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. \n\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\n\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \n: >>causing infection and disease.

Bacteria and viruses\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it \nto the present. \n\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either\nclaim.\n \n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\n: answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\n\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does\nnot work, it fails miserably.\n \n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\n: \n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\n: that affect mankind?  I don't think so.\n\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\n\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\n: Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\n: universe.\n\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\n\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\n  \n: Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)\n\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\n\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\n\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\nthese books.\n\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\n \n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\n: of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\n: environment.\n\nI'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,\nand no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.\nIt can come into existence without a Supreme Being.\n\nTry reading P.W.

Massive amounts of regolith would\nhave to be processed.\n\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\n\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \"high-Ti\" basalts (Apollo 11\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\nbasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\nmined today).\n\n\tPaul F.

This directory can be used for things like\narticles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,\nthe RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not\nmeant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.\n\nSo, in the future if you're looking for something check there first\nand then ask here.\n\nInstructions:\n\nShort version for techies:\n\nThe site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the\ndirectory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands\nget, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \"type binary\"\nto be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved\nto the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.\n\nI will maintain an index which you should get first to check if\nthe file you want to read or write already is archived.\n\nLong version for non-techies:\n\nIn order for you to use this archive your computer must be on\nthe Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:\n\n\tftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu\n\nIf that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp\ncommand is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a\nlogin:\n\tName (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):\n\nInstead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:\n\n\tftp\n\nNext you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:\n\n\tGuest login ok, send e-mail address as password:\n\nI would enter:\n\n\tl.v.cipriani@att.com\n\nYou'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines\nor similar as output:\n\n\tRemote system is UNIX.\n\tUsing binary mode to transfer files.\n\nNext, the command prompt is printed:\n\n\tftp> \n\nIf you do not get the line \"Using binary mode to transfer files.\"\nRun the command:\n\n\ttype binary\n\nNow you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many\ndirectories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are\n\n\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nand\n\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nThere are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.\n\nWhen you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive\nfiles change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:\n\n\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nor\n\tcd pub/firearms/politics/rkba\n\nTo submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with\nthe command:\n\n\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\nor\n\tcd pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nOnce you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter\nanother command.\n\nTo find the names of the existing files in the directory you are\nin run the command:\n\n\tls -l\n\nThis will produce something like:\n\ntotal 6021\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias\n-r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu\n... and so on ...\n\nEach line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields\nare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of\nthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need\nto be concerned with.\n\nTo get a file run the command \"get\" followed by the name of the file\nyou want, for example:\n\n\tget INDEX\nor\n\tget noduty\n\nAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:\n\n\tTransfer complete.\n\t19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)\n\nYou can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.\nYou can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the\nfile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025\nyou should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first\nand then retrieve it:\n\n\tcd congress/103rd\n\tget HR1025\n\nOnce you're finished you can log off with the command:\n\n\tquit\n\nIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little\ndifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file already\nexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above\nand look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The\nindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkba\ndirectory.  For example:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFile: whitemanslaw\n\nWhite Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985\nReason magazine\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login\nand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once\nyou are in the incoming directory use the command:\n\n\tput file_name\n\nIn this case:\n\n\tput whitemanslaw\n\nAgain there'll be a \"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered\nin so many seconds\" message.  Now your file is on the archive\nmachine.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure\nthere isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same\nas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll\noverwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].\n\nYour file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a\nfile by the same name in the rkba directory.\n\nOnce your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for\nthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.\n\nIf you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute\na file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.\n\nIf you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so\nbe sure to let me know first.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nMichael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..\n                (internal) mjp@bwa.kgn.ibm.com .. mjp at kgnvmy         \n (and last but not least a disclaimer)  These opinions are mine..       \n"}, {"text": "Subject: HINT 486 VLB/ISA/EISA motherboard\nFrom: schauf@iastate.edu (Brian J Schaufenbuel)\nDistribution: usa\nOrganization: Iowa State University, Ames, IA\nKeywords: 486, motherboard\nLines: 13\n\n\n\nI am looking at buying some Companion brand VLB/ISA/EISA motherboards with\nHINT chipsets.

Gurman) writes:\n>    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only\n>(can't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133), so your best bet\n\nThat's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\nDESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\n\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\n\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\n    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\n\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\n      self-terminated or not.\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\n\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\n      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable\n      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).\n    - get a 25ohm terminator.\n\nYour two-machine network will look like this:\n\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                           |\n      +-----+                                         +-----+\n                                                      |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n     5000/200                                           650\n                              OR\n\n       ##T----------------------------------------------[]\n        {=}                                             |\n      +-----+                                           |\n      |     |                                         +-----+\n      +-----+                                         |     |\n                                                      +-----+\n    DECstation                                        Centris\n5000/25,125,133,240                                     650\n         \n   ##    -> 25ohm terminator\n   T     -> T connector\n   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)\n   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter\n   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)\n   |\n   |\n\nAndy\n-- \nAndy Sun (andy@ie.utoronto.ca)          4 Taddle Creek Road, Toronto\nComputing Coordinator                   Ontario, Canada.

The critical information from the neuron is in\nthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per\nseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the\nsignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit\nconvertor is more then sufficient.\n\nAC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases\nyou are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled\nalso. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If\nthe cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly\ndistorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the\noccurrence of the spike that is important. \n\nHowever, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start\nbattling with the toolbox to get it going.

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  \ntry yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     \nacidophilus in its contents.                                            \n--- end ---\n              \n\n                              \n===================================\n\nInfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92\n  THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED\n  ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS\n  MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the    \norganisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    \nintestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the \ndisease is commonly called thrush.                                      \n  Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control     \npills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.   \nAmong narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve      \ninflammation.                                                           \n  Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood    \ntests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole.\nThere is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals\nleads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in     \ntheir intestines.

Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, \ncomp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.\n\nThe most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or\nvia anonymous ftp:\n\nrtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq\n\nThose without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\nwith \"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body to find out\nhow to do FTP by e-mail.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \nList of questions in the Gopher FAQ:\n\nQ0:  What is Gopher?\nQ1:  Where can I get Gopher software?\nQ2:  What do I need to access Gopher?\nQ3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher?\nQ4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?\nQ5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?\nQ6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?\nQ7: What is veronica?\nQ8: What is Available for Biology?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ0:  What is Gopher?\n\nA0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed\n     information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide\n     information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While\n     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher\n     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers\n     throughout the world. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ1:  Where can I get Gopher software?\n\nA1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory\n     /pub/gopher\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ2:  What do I need to access Gopher?\n\nA2:  You will need a gopher \"client\" program that runs on your local PC\n     or workstation\n\n     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory\n     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous\n     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory\n     /pub/gopher.\n\n      Unix Curses & Emacs   :  /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z\n      Xwindows (athena)     :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z\n      Xwindows (Motif)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/moog\n      Xwindows (Xview)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xvgopher\n      Macintosh Hypercard   :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/old-versions *\n      Macintosh Application :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher *\n      DOS w/Clarkson Driver :  /pub/gopher/PC_client/\n      NeXTstep              :  /pub/gopher/NeXT/\n      VM/CMS                :  /pub/gopher/Rice_CMS/ or /pub/gopher/VieGOPHER/\n      VMS                   :  /pub/gopher/VMS/\n      OS/2 2.0\t            :  /pub/gopher/os2/\n      MVS/XA                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/\n\n     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the\n     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  \n\n      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client \"The Gopher Book\"\n        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip\n\n      A Macintosh Application, \"MacGopher\".\n        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *\n\n      Another Macintosh application, \"GopherApp\".\n        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *\n\n      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP\n        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe\n\n      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS\n     \t bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe\n\n      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace\n      for DOS\n         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher\n\n      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX\n         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE\n\n\n     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.\n\n     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client\n     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:\n\n       Type=1\n       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu\n       Port=70\n       Path=\n       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.\n\n \n     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and\n     look in the gopher directory.\n\n\n     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.\n     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine\n     \"consultant.micro.umn.edu\" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more\n     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client\n     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A\n     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,\n     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to\n     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?\n\nA3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize\n     network lag.\n\n     Telnet Public Logins:\n\n     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area\n     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------\n     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4\tgopher  North America\n     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America\n     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201\tpanda   North America\n     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe\n     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia\n     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden\n     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America\n     ecnet.ec\t\t           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador\n     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan\n\n\n     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of\n     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the\n     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)\n     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features\n     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file\n     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp\n     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?\n\nA4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University\n     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help\n     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  \n\n     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information\n     System used by a large number of sites in the world.\n\n     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to\n     count. \n\n     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached\n     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:\n   \n      Internet Gopher Developers\n      100 Union St. SE #190\n      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA\n\n     Or via FAX at:\n \n      +1 (612) 625-6817\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?\n\nA5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.\n     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: \n     \n       - Search local WAIS indices.\n       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher\n         clients.\n       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher\n         clients.\n       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using\n         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?\n\nA6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :\n\n     _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:\n                             ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)\n\n     _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online\"\n     By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

As archie is to ftp archives, veronica \n     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher\n     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.\n     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy\n     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the\n     gopher protocol.\n\n     To try veronica, select it from the \"Other Gophers\" menu on \n     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:\n\n     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) \n     Type=1 \n     Port=70 \n     Path=1/veronica \n     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ8: What is Available for Biology?\n\nA8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information\n    availble to biologists now by gopher.\n\nHere is a brief list of the Biological Databases that you can search \nvia gopher:\n\n      2.

Considering \nthe confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO \ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \nof my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these \nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \n\n\n\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \n\n\nI'd like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n\n\n(P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, \njust a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know \nthat other people may not accept it without a complaint.)  \n"}, {"text": "From: djanzen@kits.sfu.ca ('69 Dart)\nSubject: '88 Corolla 5spd.\nOrganization: Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada\nLines: 12\n\nHi there, maybe you can help me...\n\nI have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.

Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \ntrial for the shooting?\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?\n\nPlease send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g\na little faster than I can handle.

Just a simple question.\n\n...with a simple answer!\n\n[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox\n[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is\n[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism\n[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. \n\nThe vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian\nApostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians \nin Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  \n\n[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia\n[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.\n\nThis is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in\ncertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,\nTurks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all\nArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger \nsociety.\n\n[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what\n[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian\n[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion\n[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak\n[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the\n[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian \n[EE] consciousness.\n\nThe Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless\nof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian\nnationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later \nstages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to \nIslam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This \npractice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy \nof clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these\nconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. \n\n[EE] Any information will be appreciated.\n\nYou answered your own question!
