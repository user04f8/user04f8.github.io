All the clamor \nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\n\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \nwarrented.\n\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \nrestricting calcium intake.\n\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans \nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \ninfections should decline.\n\nMarty B.\n"}, {"text": "From: cjackson@adobe.com (Curtis Jackson)\nSubject: Re: New to Motorcycles...\nOrganization: Adobe Systems Incorporated, Mountain View\nLines: 26\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.131800.16136@alw.nih.gov> gregh@niagara.dcrt.nih.gov (Gregory Humphreys) writes:\n}1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n}to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n}ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nThe following numbers are approximate, and will no doubt get me flamed:\n\nHelmet (new, but cheap)\t\t\t\t\t$100\nJacket (used or very cheap)\t\t\t\t$100\nGloves (nothing special)\t\t\t\t$ 20\nMotorcycle Safety Foundation riding course (a must!)\t$140\n\nThat leaves you between $900 and $1000 (depending on the accuracy\nof my numbers) to buy a used bike, get it registered, get it\ninsured, and get it running properly.

At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if\nat all.  The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need\nto be at 4K RPM to get it.  \n\n>3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing\n>in the morning.

Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the\nthrottle.  It should fire.  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle.\nMy R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.\n\nIt's an EXPERIENCE thing.  Like Zen, it's hard to describe.  It can be hard\nto learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success\nand failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the\nbattery while trying to get it to run.\n\nIf my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to\nstart.  If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to\nvaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off.  I've got dual\nplugs which make it easier to start.\n\n>4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline\n>with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep\n>the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any \n>particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?\n\nThe BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit.  It's good for a few MPG and the\nparts are alcohol proof.  The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof.  As\nlong as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time, gasohol is\nnice since it helps keep ping away.  If your bike doesn't ping on cheap gas\nyou ought to raise the compression! (Half a smiley, the BMW twins of the\n80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\n\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\n\t\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\n\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\n\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\n\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\n\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\nreferences though, \"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\nfurther context).  \n\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\" He then\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\ndenoted as the result). \n\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\n\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\n> it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \n> died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> ^^^^ \n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\n> result.\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\n\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \n\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\nhistorical source to justify it. \n\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:\n\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \n\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\nas the 30 silvers:\n\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\n> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\n> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\n> that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\n> discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\n> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\n> \n>  \n> Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\n> that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\n> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\n> obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\n>          ^^^^^^\n\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\nthe money box, but rather said:\n\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\n     it was night.\"\n\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \n\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\nthat night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \n\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\n\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\n\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\n> this with you.\n\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now.

Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you\never hire that guy anyhow?\n\nCox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEric Roush\t\tfierkelab@\tbchm.biochem.duke.edu\n\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\"\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\n\nTANSTAAFL!

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\n\n>\"...

And such were \n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\n\n\t\"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything\n\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\n\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\n\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary\nargument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.\n\nI won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\n\nI'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\nof the ritual law?\n\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\n\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\n\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\nyou can think of to do so.\n\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\nWHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\ncondemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\n\nWhy, for God's sake?\n\n\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\n\tto condemn the world,\n\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\n\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\n\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\n\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.\n\tNow the judgment is this:\n\tthe light has come into the world,\n\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\n\tbecause their deeds were evil.\n\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\n\thates the light,\n\tand does not come near the light\n\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\n\tBut he who acts in truth\n\tcomes into the light,\n\tso that it may be sh0own\n\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\tJohn 3:17-21\n\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\nrejected.

Blessed are those whose spirits\nhave been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.\n\nHowever, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;\nand we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who\nfear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow\nit with the darkness of false witness against us.\n-- \nMichael L.

And key size is one of the things that can be\nverified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\nchip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\noutput.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\nbits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\n\nIf they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\nsome of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\nthey only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\nDES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\nchange rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\nNSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\n\nRemember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\nthe cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\nsubkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee\ncan and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified\nlater against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some\nsecure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without\nit being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.\n(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee\nmembers can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which\nyou have to XOR together to recover the program...\n\nSeriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the\npeople who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game\nand the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not\ngoing to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility\nis the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied\nabout the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence\nof other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will\nbelieve that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.\nIf they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,\nno one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.\n\nThat isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things\nanyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem\nwith a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took\nfor folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely\npossible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just\nsuch reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to\na Senator...).\n\n> Anyway, its looking like the\n> keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA\n> can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number.\n\nI don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.\nHowever -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same\nescrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,\nthey can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.\n\nI still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.

For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\n Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would\n have been.\n\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\n the carcass of Djul.

Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,\n but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust\n of promises made by tribal chiefs.

'Our men also attack from the other sides.'\n\n Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke.

Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses.

I have been\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\n\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\nplugs and valve adjustment.\n\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\nhighway.\n\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\nVisibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\n\n    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\nride later in this review.\n\n\nEngine:\n    \n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha \"Shogun\" engine.  I was not\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\nI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\n(More on this later.)\n\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\n\n    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\nadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves\nare used.\n\n\nTransmission:\n\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\n\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\nlarger and more forgiving.\n\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's\na clumsy shifter.\n\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\npretty amazing in a car like this.\n\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\nToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\n\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter\nupgrade would help at all.\n\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\nwere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\nshifts in higher gears.)\n\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \nget it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple\nof months.\n\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a \"SHO\nsound\" and is the gearbox -- apparently called \"gear rollover\".\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\n\n\nExterior:\n\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\ndon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\n\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\n\"SHO\" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\n\n    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\n\n\nInterior:\n\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \n\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\ncassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\nglove compartment.\n\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\nsink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the\ninterior was upgraded!\n\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\n\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\nwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has\ncracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\nway.\n\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\n\n\nRide:\n\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than\nany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\n\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\n\n    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason\nto complain.  Let me explain...\n\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\navoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.\n\n    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\n\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\nwheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when\ndriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so\nuseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road\nto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better\nthan the steering on my Celica ST.\n\n    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?\n\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n    GRIPES:\n\n    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles\n        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.\n\n    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as\n\tit retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.\n\tAgain, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)\n\n    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension\n\tand torque steer, I've never complained about ride.\n\n    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the\n\tside bolsters would close more tightly.  \n\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\n\tcurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\n\tfor four.\n\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\n\tto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't\n\treally mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!\n\tPretty ridiculous, though.\n\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\n\tthis is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\n\tdown low.\n\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\n\ttook me a couple of days before I could really shift\n\tsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)\n\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\n\tit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \n\tAstute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\n\tmy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled \"Drive It Forever\"\n\tfor tips in this department.  :-)\n\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\n\tparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\n\tafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\n\tthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \n\tis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \n\tto wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \n\tparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \n\tthe glowing brake light.  Oops.)\n\n    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same\n    \tthing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the\n\tother windows work smoothly.\n\n\n    LIKES:\n\n    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The\n    \tcupholders are great.\n\n    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but\n\tit really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by\n\tpressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And\n\tyou can never lock yourself out of the car.\n\n    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't\n\tbelieve that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years \n\tahead of schedule.  :-)\n\n    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to\n\tlook into buying one.  I love this car so much that I\n\twrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines\n\tand ended up with this.  \n\n    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have\n\tan opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this \n\tcar.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this\n\tpoint in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you\n\tcan't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)\n\n    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums\n\tas on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice\n\tthe horsepower.  \n\n\n\nOther Odds and Ends:\n\n    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.\nMaybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I\nhaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still\nappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always\nquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some\nof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)\n\n    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as\nwell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be \nposting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  \n\n    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!\nI don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but \nmaybe someone out there does.\n\n\nGene Kim\n(genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: georgian@tigger.jvnc.net (Ops Mgr)\nSubject: 210M SCSI HD 3.5\" For Sale\nSummary: New Drives, Unused\nOriginator: ENS@tigger.jvnc.net\nKeywords: 210M SCSI disk drives forsale\nNntp-Posting-Host: tigger.jvnc.net\nReply-To: lee%polarsun@rna.rockefeller.edu\nOrganization: JvNCnet\nLines: 35\n\nPlease reply to the seller below.\n\n210M Formatted SCSI Hard Disk 3.5\"\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n    Rodime 3259TS  (3 available)\n\n    New Drives, Unused\n\n    Capacity, formatted Mbytes:   210.0\n    Number of data heads:             5\n    Number of cylinders:          1,235\n    Track density, tpi:            1700\n    Positioning times -\n     Track-to-track        5ms\n     Average              18ms\n     Full Stroke (Max)    20ms\n    Rotational speed, RPM:       3600\n    Avg. rotational latency:   8.33ms\n    SCSI Bus transfer rate:    4M/sec\n    Cache:                        48K\n\n  Guaranteed against DOA\n\n  Works with Sun, PC, Mac, & misc. other workstations\n\n  These are internal drives\n  No external drive enclosure is included\n\n Price: $225 each, including COD insured\n        shipping within the continental U.S.\n\nPlease email responses to:\n\n   \\\\Lee\nlee%polarsun@rna.rockefeller.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: jcopelan@nyx.cs.du.edu (The One and Only)\nSubject: Re: Amusing atheists and agnostics\nOrganization: Nyx, Public Access Unix at U. of Denver Math/CS dept.\nLines: 24\n\nIn article <1qsum1INNg5k@shelley.u.washington.edu> jimh@carson.u.washington.edu (James Hogan) writes:\n>\n>I think you've missed the point.

The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights\n3.   The Human Rights Charter\n4.   The European Convention of Human Rights\n\nIf one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these\nlegally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is\nobvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination.\n\n\nThe people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion\nby the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live\nunder Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.\n\nThey are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole\nreason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any\nprovisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance.\nIsrael's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing\nthe return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of\nthe State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under\ninternational law and could be justified in asking to be recognized.

Owning slaves was common practice back then. Paul\nspeaks about everything else that is immoral. He apparently thought it\nwas important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard.
