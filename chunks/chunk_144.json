Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are\ntopically aranged together in the law.  This is very important.\nAnyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality\ndeals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there\nis no proof for this.)  If the Law reveals the character of God, and \nis \"holy, just, and good\" as is written in the New Testament, then\nthose who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts\nto be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture.  \n\nWhy must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human\nadult relationships?  Isn't that bordering on sophistry?  The point\nwe are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts.\nNot everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional\nargument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors.\nThe issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.  \n\nI do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a member\nof the same sex.  I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is \nthe sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after.\nSo other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation. \n\nAnd the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships\nbetween adult humans is red herring.  We all agree that it is okay \nfor adults to  have caring relationships with one another.\n\nLink Hudson.\n"}, {"text": "From: david@stat.com (David Dodell)\nSubject: HICN611 Medical News Part 1/4\nReply-To: david@stat.com (David Dodell)\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Stat Gateway Service, WB7TPY\nLines: 707\n\n------------- cut here -----------------\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n              +------------------------------------------------+\n              !                                                !\n              !

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital \nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center \nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \nof 1.96. \n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \n\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \ncharges. \n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely \noffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nnational data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) \nwas 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \nrate. \n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \ndelivery (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\nconfirmed as having malaria. \n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \n128 (82%) responded. \n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \nmalaria. \n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \nevening. \n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \n\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \nshort-term travelers to such areas. \n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \nfalciparum has not been reported. \n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \n\"yellow book\") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \ninjections. \n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \n\n                               ActHIB Trademark \n\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \n\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

An international steering committee and scientific \nprogram committee provided guidance. \n     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including \nAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United \nStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \nwomen's issues. \n\n                                Recommendations\n\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \n\n                                 Epidemiology\n\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \nchildren and adolescents. \n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \nare appearing all the time. \n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \nand prognosis. \n\n                            Social/political Issues\n\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \nfocused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for \nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \n\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\n\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \n\n                               Pediatric Issues\n\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With \nearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-\ninfected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from \nmother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's \nsero-status is known prior to giving birth. \n\n                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 12\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and \ngingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.  Recommendations made at \nthe workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of \ndiagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration \nof confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. \n\n                       Occupational and Treatment Issues\n\n     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals \nand treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command \nconsiderable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit \nof HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection \nand the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the \ntreatment of HIV-infected patients. \n     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on \nthe Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.  \nProceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence \nCompany in late 1993.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------- end of part 1 ------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\n"}, {"text": "From: cubrj@uxa.ecn.bgu.edu (Brian Johnson)\nSubject: the hawks WILL return to the finals!!!!!\nOrganization: Educational Computing Network\nLines: 11\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: uxa.ecn.bgu.edu\n\nWell now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little\neasier for the playoffs.

Anthony Fauci, director of the \nU.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, \n\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly \ncan with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will \nget around microbial resistance.\"  He said any delay would signify questions \nover safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co-\nauthored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the  \nargument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery \nindicates that \"$1 billion spent on vaccine trials\" has been \"a waste of time \nand money\" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were \ninfected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of \nVirginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument \nfor  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the \nnew information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand \nthe significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  \"We've known about this \nfor five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain,\" said Jesse \nDobson of the  California-based Project Inform.

The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the \nOffice time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much \nmore [than  public relations].\" \n======================================================================   \n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \n\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\n6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  \nfound that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, \nwhich is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \"We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children.\" \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. \n\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We'll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \nbe told what they receive. \n\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \nbegin. \n\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \n\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E.

It provides information on \ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \nSan Francisco General Hospital. \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA's associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \"Providers who treat people with \nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\" \n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \n\n\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\n\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\n\f\n------------- cut here -----------------\n-- This is the last part ---------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\n"}, {"text": "From: simsh@aix02.ecs.rpi.edu (Hillel Y.

There\n>is a book \"The Yeast Connection\" which talks about this \"illness\".\n>\n>There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.\n\nThere's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and\npublished in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics\nwho quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.\n\nFor example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book \"Sinus Survival\", always gives,\nbefore any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his\nnew patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times\nin the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over \n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\nprogram.\n\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\nsymptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly \nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\n\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\nsorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\nsince that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\n\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\n\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\nto the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\nface that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee\ntheir safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as\nfar as I am concerned.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

To me,\nan absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,\nsituations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree\nwith this definition?  I think you do:\n\n> Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a \n> contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always\n> true.

Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, \nthis is truth and therefore absolute.  \n\nDo women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all \nscripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and \ncoming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  \nYet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare \nheads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew \nup in.)\n\nEvangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \nto be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\nCan you reconcile this?\n\n> Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a\n> statement is terribly self-contradictory.

How can you\ndetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how\nto interpret the Scripture?  \n\nIt's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based \non your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own\nbackground, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the \nBible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that \nyou in fact interpret?\n\nCarol Alvin\ncaralv@auto-trol.com\n"}, {"text": "From: isaackuo@skippy.berkeley.edu (Isaac Kuo)\nSubject: Re: Electrical Spacecraft via Magnetic field of earth?\nOrganization: U.C.

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John's once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION\t\t\t\tANOTHER OPTION\n\t\t\t\nNorthern Division\t\t\tSouthern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\t\t\tADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\t\t\tSPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\t\t\tPROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS\t\t\t\tCDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES\t\t\tHERSHEY\n\t\t\t\t\tBINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division\t\t\tROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS\t\t\t\tHAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\t\t\tUTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\t\t\tAtlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

Sex, or Christianity?\n\nI'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:\n\n\tWhat's more important to Christians?  Love of God or love\n\tof other human beings?\n\nto which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like\nthe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any \"flavor\" of Christianity\nwhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a \"priority\"\nover the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let\nthe dead bury the dead, to \"hate\" family rather than let it keep us from\nfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our\nfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us\nto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God\nin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different\nlevel than the one who is so caught up in \"love\" of God.\n\nThe trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it\nhas sometimes been the case that the Church has \"taught\" that all sex\nwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental\nhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the\nvehicle of becoming \"one flesh\" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what\nis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I\nmean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social\ninteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of\nmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and\nfoster the children they beget and support their children's mothers.\nThis is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation of\nthat passage.)\n\n\t[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as\n\t  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes\n\t  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not\n\t  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the\n\t  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are\n\t  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of\n\t  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]\n\nYes, of course it sometimes goes \"wrong\" -- like all else we do, it is\ninfected with sin, and you find married \"couples\" where there is no bond,\nand people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond\nformation (the \"infatuation\", \"falling in love\" phase) that they break\nany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep\nunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.\nSatan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --\nbut in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's grace\nunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem\nfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil\nis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)\n\nSo, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT\nChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that\nsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable\nto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the\nhard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to\neach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the \"proper\" preparation for an\nimmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should\nact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our\nmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to\nbond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause\nof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints\nhave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,\nmind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual\nlife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in\nthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We\nare human, and little good comes of trying to \"mortify the flesh\" to the\npoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.\n\n>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex\n>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,\n\nIt depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy\non the part of those who find us \"stumbling blocks\" I am much less of\na mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.\n\nThere are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,\nand maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that\nseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read\nas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our\nconspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop to\nthe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded\nin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;\ntelling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)\nis fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our\nspiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of\nspeaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet\nanother prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some\n*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.\n-- \nMichael L.

If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.\n\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\nless you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've\nlearned a few tricks I think...\n"}, {"text": "From: jebright@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (James R Ebright)\nSubject: Re: WH proposal from Police point of view\nNntp-Posting-Host: bottom.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\nOrganization: The Ohio State University\nLines: 34\n\nIn article <PMETZGER.93Apr19122105@snark.shearson.com> pmetzger@lehman.com writes:\n>\n>In article <strnlghtC5puor.704@netcom.com> strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) writes:\n>\n>   There has been extensive discussion in the eff forum, for example, about\n>   inadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to\n>   admissible evidence.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\nBooks, Inc.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\nDC  20006.\n\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\n\n  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far\nmore than that.\n\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\n\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\n\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\nmatter how risky they may be.\n\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\nmy friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.\n\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\n\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\nreign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\n\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\n\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\nNavy.\n\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\n\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\n\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\nthem.\n\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\n\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\n\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\n\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\n\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\nnot Britain.\n\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\nIsland at all?\n\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\nenormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\nI will describe shortly.\n\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\nWashington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\nand verify them.\n\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\n\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\nthe world.\n\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\nand Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\n\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\nBrothers.\n\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\n\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\nHemisphere war.\n\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\nbut very little of the air changes places.\n\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\nnatural resources.\n\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\nNo. 36.\n\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\nRockefellers.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\ninherit the Earth.\n\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\n\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\n\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme\nimportance in the coming war.\n\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\ndown virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\n\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\nPacific.\n\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\n\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. \nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\nappearance both during and after construction.\n\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\n\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara\npresided over the public paring back of America's visible\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\n\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\ntechniques.\n\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\n\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\n\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\n\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\ngenerates the field.\n\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\nStates Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\n\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\n\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\nWAR ONE.\n\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\nWashington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\nwith Russia.\n\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\n\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\nfast running out.\n\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\ncertain ways.\n\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\n\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\n\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\n\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\nare known to be as I described last month.\n\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\n\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\n\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\n\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\nalso its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\n\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\ndo.\n\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\n\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\nthe Argentine flag.\n\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\n\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\n\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\nwould be a nerve gas.\n\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\ncontrolled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\n\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\ndoors would be suicide.\n\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\npreparations.\n\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\n\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\ncertain officials.  He got them!\n\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\n\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\nshambles of the plan.\n\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\nknown, there were no survivors.\n\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\nresults, both important:\n\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\n\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\nNew Zealand!\n\n   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\n\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\nstill out of range.\n\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\n\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\ntactics which the Russians employed.\n\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\naround the world.\n\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\n\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\nthere were a nuclear war.\n\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\nmoney--and plenty of it.\n\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\nmachine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\n\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\nand Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\nRockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity\nright now for the Rockefellers.\n\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\n\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. \nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\n\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\n\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\n\n   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea\nmay well be at hand.\n\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"\n\n   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.

Well,\nthink again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\n\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\nBCGA65431. You'll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.\n\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \nsuggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\nit worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\n\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\n\nIf the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\nthe details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.\n\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\nwill eventually be forced to respond.

However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\nIn article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com \n    (Dick King) writes:\n>  [ Somebody writes: ]\n>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....\n>  ....\n>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a\n>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.\n>         ....\n>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out\n>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\"\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\n"}, {"text": "From: dly@joule.elee.calpoly.edu (Dixon Ly)\nSubject: Re: Challenge to Microsoft supporters.\nOrganization: Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 50\n\nIn article <14989@news.duke.edu> kdb@teer13.acpub.duke.edu (Kurt Bollacker) writes:\n>Rick Schaut (richs@microsoft.com) wrote:\n>: In article <14822@news.duke.edu> kdb@sunbar.mc.duke.edu (Kurt Bollacker) writes:\n>: >I agree.
