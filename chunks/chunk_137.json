As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf\nRomans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as\npurgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it\nis impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.

Which is why Jesus said,\n\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless\nhe is born of water and Spirit\" which is the true meaning of born again\n(John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be\ncut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.\n\nAs St. Augustine said, \"I did not invent original sin, which the\nCatholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a\ndoubt are a follower of a new heresy.\"  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)\n\nAndy Byler\n"}, {"text": "From: rdell@cbnewsf.cb.att.com (richard.b.dell)\nSubject: Re: Lead Acid batteries & Concrete?\nOrganization: AT&T\nDistribution: na\nLines: 31\n\nIn article <1993Apr21.204556.21262@cronkite.ocis.temple.edu> camter28@astro.ocis.temple.edu (Carter Ames) writes:\n>\n>   I was just wondering one thing, actually two.

In storage,\neither the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance\nI'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a trickle\ncharge.  I have also (I think) read that the condition may be reversable\nif hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time.\nThe refernce I remember is to use C/50 (where C is the amp hours) as the\ncharging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks.

There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \n          after the life of Jesus. \n    \n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \n          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \n          teaching of REincarnation. \n       \n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \n          UNIVERSES.)                             \n\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \n      \n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \n          indicator for religious validity. \n    \n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \n          other major world religions, including Islam. \n     \n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \n          \"silver cord\". \n    \n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of \n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \n          Master. \n    \n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \n    \n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \n          Mat\" organization. \n      \n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \n    \n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \n          classic. \n    \n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \n          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \n          Jesus was. \n    \n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \n          Master. \n    \n          \n    \n          RE-INCARNATION\n          \n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \n          \n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \n          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, \n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \n          INCARNATION. \n\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \n\n\n\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\n\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \n          waiting for Jesus' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \n    \n          \n          \n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\n\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \n    \n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \n    \n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \n          \n          \n          \n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\n\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \n       \n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \n          CONTINUE. \n    \n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \n          a Member.

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.\nThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\n\nI've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\n\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\n   water.\n\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\n\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\n\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\nstory here.\n\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\n\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe\nthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that\nthe victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test\ninvolving the specific gravity of a body fluid?\n\nPaul.\n-- \nPaul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).\t    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245\n--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------\nThese ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is not\nfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions\n"}, {"text": "From: amj@rsf.atd.ucar.edu (Anthony Michael Jivoin)\nSubject: Re: Bosox win again!

The heat source\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\nspaced every 6\" starting about 10\" above the bulb.\n\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.

I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple\nterminal emulator program).\n\nThe problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the\nserver for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely\nspaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the \nrightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the \nrightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is an\ninvisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous\ncharacter.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns\na complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual\ncharacters.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to\nfind it, it would be much appreciated.\n\nRegards and thanks, Jon Dhuse.\n\n-- \n Jon Dhuse              |     Internet: jdhuse@sedona.intel.com\n Intel  Corp.

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,\nI only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I\nestimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.\n\nVery little sugar or salt.\n\nVery high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are\nrecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard\nof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can\ncontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as\nlikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are\njust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)\n\nMy \"clean your plate\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last\n10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch\nup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.\n\nI don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry\nshortly, and eating won't be practical then).\n\nI bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to\nstores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.\nI estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps\nbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes\nruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my\nmetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable\nwith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if\nit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess\nounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that\nweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim\nweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)\n\nThere's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically\ndifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,\nit isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.\n\nObviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've\ndone will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who\ndid try it and didn't succeed.\n\n> I think all of us cycle.  One's success depends on how large the\n> fluctuations in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.\n\nI'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.\nI usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,\nmy weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.

It summarizes\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\nit?\"\n\nFirst, on the definition of 'homosexual'.  Many groups believe that\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\nterm 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups.  In\nthis paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven't heard of any\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\nremains celebate.\n\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\nhomosexual.  This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'.  It is\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality is\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\nExodus International\".  The reports I've seen (and I haven't read the\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\nPresbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\nthat it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\nthan the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\nit's wrong, it's wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\nIf it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\nwilling to forgive it.\n\nOne more general background issue: It's common to quote a figure that\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\nthis came from.  Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can't\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\ninformation for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\nat Rutgers:\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study, but the scholarly\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\n\nI've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study, but not in enough\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\nview, I'd be willing to include it.)\n\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\nhave congregational government, you'll find a few congregations that\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\nanother issue.  I don't have any doubt that there are homosexual\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\n\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here's an\nattempt to summarize the issues:\n\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\n1980.\n\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\n(There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you'll see that few\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There's a Jewish\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\nrate, there's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\n\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\n\nThe NT references are all in Paul's letters.  A number of the\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\nmean homosexual.  Here's what he says: The two Greek words that appear\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\n\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on I\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\nisn't a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul's writing is the first\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since it\ndoesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It's dangerous to base\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\nreligious expression because it's based on \"God by with ye\".  However\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\ntheir translation).\n\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\nwhat Paul meant.\n\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it's homosexuality that\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I'm sure Paul\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\n\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\nin passing.\n\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view of\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There's not a lot I\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\n\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\nI'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\nquestion of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modern\nhomosexuality.\n\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\njudgements on these questions.\n\nAnother is the following: In Paul's time homosexuality was associated\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I'm\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\npartners.  (However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\nin this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\ninvolve slaves or children.)\n\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\nhomosexuality.  I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\nnot at risk for AIDS.\n\nNote that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubt\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\nmarriage as what God ordained.\n\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\n\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\ntempted to fornication.\n\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\ndoesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\nor whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you're willing to consider the latter\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\n\nThis is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\n\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we've\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\nthis situation.  I've also seen summaries of various research and the\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there's an FAQ that summarizes\nour readers' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn't happen,\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\nhomosexuality isn't God's original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\nsuggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love\nwith each other.\n\nThere's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\nrelative?\n\nWhen looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completely\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\n\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\n\tthe OT -- it's not in the NT, but I mention it here because\n\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\n\ton Christians)\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\n\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\n\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\n\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\n\tbut not to our market economy.\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\n\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\n\tconcerned about\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\n\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\n\tan institution\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\n\tRoman tax farming\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\nor slaves of God.)\n\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\nrelative.  Rather, I'm trying to say that *some* things are, and\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\naction we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\nhomosexuality are still binding, I'm willing to listen.  Those who\nclaim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\nall the rules listed above).\n\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\ncan't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\ndangerous situation for Christians.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\ndon't see it as an argument for acceptability.\n\nMany people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug\naddiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn't mean it's OK.\nMost of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people\nget angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be\nattraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if\nwe view it as wrong) wouldn't be different than any of these other\nthings.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or\nanother having to work to overcome bad habits and particular\ntemptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say\nthat because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus\nsaid, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying\nto self (which also appears throughout Paul's letters) seems to\nsuggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we\nare called on not to accept.  Paul's letters and the experience of\nChristians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and\nthe battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that\nhomosexuality is difficult to fight doesn't necessarily say it's OK.\nMaybe this isn't the place where we have to die to self.  But I'd like\nto make sure that those who think it isn't are fighting the battle\nsomewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have\nto fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.\n"}, {"text": "From: woobin@dance.ee.washington.edu (Woobin Lee)\nSubject: Re: .Extensions\nOrganization: Image Computing Systems Lab, University of Washington\nLines: 28\nNNTP-Posting-Host: dance.ee.washington.edu\n\nIn article <1993Apr22.114401.7152@ericsson.se> etxmst@sta.ericsson.se writes:\n>I was wondering what the country extension are.\n>Sometimes I just don't have a clue from where\n>some people are writing.\n>\n>These are the extensions I know of\n>\n>ch   Switzerland\n>se   Sweden\n>fi   Finland\n>uk   UK\n>Com  US?\n>Edu  US?

Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it \nanyway.\n\nCheers \nPeter T.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: mcgary@intellection.com (Mike McGary)\nSubject: Re: Keyboard mapping and window placement questions\nIn-Reply-To: darcym@fpddet4.mentorg.com's message of Tue, 27 Apr 1993 18:29:12 GMT\nOrganization: Intellection, Inc.\nLines: 51\n\nIn article <1993Apr27.182912.3388@news.mentorg.com> darcym@fpddet4.mentorg.com (Darcy McCallum) writes:\n\n>   These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these\n>   specific questions.\n>\n>   1.

Now, this is not so simple because some window managers\nslap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,\nso be sure to take that into account for further calculations.\n\nCalculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using\nXGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.\nRemember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the\nwindows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAll of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the\nwindow-manager is using.\n\nNow, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate \nwhere you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on\nthe OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).\n\nDISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.

Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.
