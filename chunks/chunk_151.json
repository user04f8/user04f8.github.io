Kinda fun.  8)\n\n     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be\ncompadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  \n\n    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on\nthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read \neither :     62-000042-015 or\n             62-000094-0x2\n\n     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.\n\n>\n>Controller jumpers are set as follows: (\"-\" represents jumper)\n>\tW1\t1-2 3\n>       W2      1-2 3\n>\tW3\t1-2\n>\tW4\t1 2-3\n>\tW5\t1 2 3\n>\tW6\t1-2 3\n>\tW7\t1 2 3\n\n    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between\npins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.\n\n>The drive jumpers are as follows: (\"8\" represents jumper)\n\n    Looks right.\n  \n[art deleted]\n\n>Here are my questions:\n>\n>1.)\tAre the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?\n\n      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\n\n              5 + +    open\n              6 + +    open             \n              7 + +    open        \n              8 + +    open\n              4 + +    closed\n              3 + +    closed\n              2 + +    open\n              1 + +    open\n\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\nTop to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \n\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have\nto look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.\n\n>2.)\tAre the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?\n\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\nright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables\nare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it\nto the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   \n     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few\ntimes and banged my head for a day.....\n\n>3.)\tIs my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?\n\n     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way\nto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:\n       \n        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)\n   \n    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.\n\n>Keith Rice\n\n      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's\njust hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).\n\n                     -->   Bob Valentine  <--  \n                  --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--  \n\n\n\nFrom chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993\nReceived: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)\n\tid AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500\nReceived: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)\n\tid m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT\nMessage-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za>\nFrom: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

Then \n          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the \n          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 \n          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION \n          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY \n          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the \n          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must \n          be soldered to jumper position W-27.

The filtering is not\ninterpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal\nyou are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an\nall-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's\nheart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks\nthat weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the\nproperly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at\nthat point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not\nunreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things\nin realtime if you write efficient code.\n\nIn case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)\nfilter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out\nthere know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with\nresistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as\nthe most cost effective method for volume production runs.\n\n\n>Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\n>sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\n>antialiasing filters.

I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to\nfilter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and\ngive the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they\ncharge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.\n\nI seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).

I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.

As usual, Sahl's was \nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\n\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At \nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the \nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \ndelivery.\n\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \nideological quilt.\n\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \npages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the \nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\n\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \ncourse, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \nGod against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\n\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\n\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily \nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\n\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \ndays.)\n\tMort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf \nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \nABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio \nprogram's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a \nRICO indictment.\n\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For \nexample:\n\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\n\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \nperhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in \norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \n(page 577).\n\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The \nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media \nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\n\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\n\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\n\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\n\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble.

Boston\nplayers can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net\nexcept for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent\njob clearing away rebounds.

As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period\n2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single\ngame (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite\nbleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.

I\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\n\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the\nAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\n\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\nthe plate in his rookie year.\n\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\nWalk desrved his contract.\n\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\ncan't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through\nwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\npitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\nwasn't very fit last year.\n\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\non Patterson in stead.\n\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his\nvalue has increased immensely.\n\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\nLet's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\n\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\n\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\nnothing else will.\n\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2\nstarts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\nseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\n\n\n-Pravin Ratnam\n"}, {"text": "From: jon@bigdog (Jon Wright)\nSubject: Re: Women's Jackets?

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and\nthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\n\tIn general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating \nindependently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other\ncallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be \nregistered can explicitly call other functions necessary.\n\n[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\n\n\tXtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving\ndangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not \nactually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\n\t\n\tIt is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,\nwhich has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer\nis set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code drops\nout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \n\n\tvoid quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\n\t{\n\t\tint             answer;\n\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Really Quit?\");\n\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Are You Really Positive?\");\n\t\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t\texit(0);\n                }\n\t}\n\n\tA more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether \nto overwrite it.\n\tThis is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and\nwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the\ncalling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the \nMotif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of \ndialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \"OK\", \"Cancel\" and \n\"Help\" or equivalents:\n\n  int AskUser(w, string)\n        Widget          w;\n        char           *string;\n  {\n        int             answer=RET_NONE;\t/* some not-used marker */\n        Widget          dialog;\t\t\t/* could cache&carry, but ...*/\n        Arg             args[3];\n        int             n = 0;\n        XtAppContext    context;\n\n        n=0;\n        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,\n                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;\n        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;\n        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtManageChild(dialog);\n\n        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);\n        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {\n                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);\n        }\n        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */\n        return answer;\n  }\n\n\tThe dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same \nfunction when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user \nfinally selects one of those choices:\n\n  void response(w, client, call)\n        Widget          w;\n        XtPointer client;\n        XtPointer call;\n  {\n  int *answer = (int *) client;\n  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;\n        switch (reason->reason) {\n        case XmCR_OK:\n                *answer = RET_YES;\t/* some #define value */\n                break;\n        case XmCR_CANCEL:\n                *answer = RET_NO; \n\t\tbreak;\n        case XmCR_HELP:\n                *answer = RET_HELP;\n                break;\n        default:\n                return;\n        }\n}\n\nand the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and\ncontinues from there.\n\n[Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan's R3/contrib\nWidgetWrap library. 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?\nI have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.\n\n\tUsers of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which \nwill work on both widgets and non-widget objects.\n\n\tIf you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do \nwhat you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures \nand is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.\n\n\t#include <X11/CoreP.h>\n\t#include <X11/Xresource.h>\n\tString XtName (widget)\n\tWidget widget;\t/* WILL work with non-widget objects */\n\t{\n\treturn XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);\n\t}\n\n[7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)?\nI'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics\nwithin my Xt-based program:\n\n> canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */\n> ...\n> window = XtWindow(canvas);\t/* get the window associated with the widget */\n> ...\n> XDrawLine (...,window,...);\t/* produces error */\n\n\tThe window associated with the widget is created as a part of the \nrealization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (\"no window\") could \ncreate the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() \nbefore attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \n\tNote that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, \nbut that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also \nwait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?\n\nThe BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of \nthe screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take\nthe following steps to avoid the error:\n\n1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.\n2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.\n3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.\n4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the\nimage from the pixmap.\n5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and \nthe x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you \nthe parts of the pixmap which aren't good.\n6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.\n\n[10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?\n\n\tA number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight\ncharacter-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is\nrunning on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:\n\t\n\tdisplay = XOpenDisplay(display_name);\n\tif (display)\n\t\t{ do X stuff }\n\telse\n\t\t{ do curses or something else }\nwhere display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following\n-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case \nXOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].\n\nThis is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line \nargument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is \nadequate. [5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 128)  How do I make a \"busy cursor\" while my application is computing?\nIs it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?\n\n\tThe easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is \nas large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel \nwindow and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other \napplication. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the \nuser enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual \ndesktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code \nshould work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):\n\n     unsigned long valuemask;\n     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\n\n     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */\n     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;\n     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\n         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\n     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);\n\n     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by\n        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */\n     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,\n         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,\n         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);\n\nwhere the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,\nparticularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than\n32767.\n\nWhen you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to\nnormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse\nevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not\nhave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.\n\nIn addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor \nresource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the\ncursor without blocking pointer events.\n\n[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller \n(argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\n\n\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which \ncontinue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its \nchildren are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X \nconnection to the display. \n\tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \n\t\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));\nto close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your \nexec. You will then be able to exit the parent.\n\tAlternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file \ndescriptor to be closed on exec.\n\t\t(void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1);\n\n[Thanks to Janet Anstett (anstettj@tramp.Colorado.EDU), Gordon Freedman \n(gjf00@duts.ccc.amdahl.com); 2/91.

If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which \nmight be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave\nthe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points\nout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to\nXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be\ncalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by \nXlib or Xt functions.\n\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt\nhandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which\nhas previously been added.\n\n\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly \nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse \n(converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 131)  What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors?\n\n\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error \nhandler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or \nXlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\n\n\tIt's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input \nboth from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but \nwhich operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or \nthe other file descriptor.\n\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,\nuse XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be \ncalled every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your \nprogram's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt \ncallback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only\nnon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\n\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an \ninput handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\n\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.\nYou will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.\nXtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is \ncalled whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is\nnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always \nready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning\nand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost\nalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the \ntype of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your \nfunction to test whether there is new data:\n\t     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;\nBut, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a \nbusy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting \na timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.\n\n[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;\nOllie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\n\n\tYou can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting\nthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget\nwhich should receive the event.\n\t If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use \nXtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you\navoid a round-trip to the server.\n\tDepending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call\nits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.\n\n[courtesy Mark A.

However, the \nwindow is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --\nuntil your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will \ngenerally not appear.

The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 \nand the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be \nreversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.\n\nAlso note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong \nthing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for \nforeground and background.\n\nAnd also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program\nif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may\nnot yet have appeared.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?\n\n\tThe 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about\none of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A \nserver can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,\nunix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --\nthe 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available \nScreens on this particular Display connection.\n\tThe macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular\nScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one\nwhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.\n\tIn Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine \nthe Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.\n\t(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros\nwhich return characteristics of the Screen have \"Display\" in the names -- \nXDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)\n\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,\nset it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The \nwindow keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're \nsure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() \nto clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read \nback that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and \nit suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD \nand Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n\tNote that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a \n(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the\npixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the \noriginal pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. \n[courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?\n\t\n\tA completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly\nwindow. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have\nseveral choices:\n\t- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to\nmake non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the\nareas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers \nsupport the extension.\n\t- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for\nparticular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note \nthat there is no X notion of a \"transparent color index\".\n\t- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny \nwindows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\n\t- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent\nwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application\nwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors\nthat will appear properly.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also\nThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this\nlast option]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\n\n\tWhen using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a\nbackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing\noperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that\nthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually\nrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black\nand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical\ncoincidence will break.]\n\tIf you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be \nallocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen\npre-computed values.\n\tIf you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you \ncan take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics \ncontext) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over \nred, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. \nThis foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and \nblue.\n\n[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley \n(whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\n\n\tMake sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue \nfields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is \nfull-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) \nthe XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is \nusually black. \n\n[Thanks to Paul Asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 142)  Why can't my program get a standard colormap?\nI have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the \nstandard colormap, but it doesn't work. \n\n\tXGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does \nnot create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.\nUse xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.\n\n[1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? \n\n\tThe initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most\nservers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there \n-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using\nXFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever \ncolor you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a \nmask).

I want to check whether\nthe window exists before doing anything with it.\n\n\tBecause X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window \nwould still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an\nevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the\nevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow \nerrors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will\nwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed \nand its ID reallocated to another window.\n\n[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?\n\n\tYes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,\nthe server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that \nknows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except\nfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\n\tThe problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple \napplications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the\napplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to \ncreate a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into\nit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also\nknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\n\t[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first\napplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned\nin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\n\tNote also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level \ncooperation among your applications. \n\tNote also that two processes can share a window but should not try to \nuse the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it \nshould close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.\n\n[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?\n\n\tA number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not\nhandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return \nthe wrong child of root.

You have to do \nclient-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer\nactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you \nhave to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish \nimplementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of \nthe X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\n\tNote that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click\nbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case\nin your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise\ncheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should\nbe the single-click action or the double-click action.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 151)!

D1).  I thought I'd post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What's New\" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\nits competitiveness agenda.\n\n......\n\n\"I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen\nnow,\" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's Jet\nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  \"We've put off a lot of things we shouldn't\nhave....

It is the \"L\" word -\nLOSER !!\n\n\tThat's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\n\n\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\n(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had\nit so good. \n\n\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\ndoesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\ndiscourse about people who \"don't get it\". For those of us in the winning\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \nsuggestion of losing.\n\n\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three\nyards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \nweapon of choice these days. \n\t\n\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \nsure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\n\n\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \n\n\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \nminority.\n\n\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care\nwho's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \n\"neoconservative\" or a \"neoliberal\" depending on how much you want to limit\nthe pot.\n\n\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\nis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any\nother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in\nColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in\nthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to \nsee more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious \npreference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of \nthem be white men !!

Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types\n   available through a large collection of X resources.\n2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.\n3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.\n4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.\n5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget \n   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar \n   to X programmers.\n6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.\n   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical\n   layout of an application.\n \nC Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:\n \n1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library\n   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C\n   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.\n2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse \n   interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control\n   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.\n3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \"two-call\"\n   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available\n   with minimal programming effort.\n4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling\n   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot\n   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can \n   control the event loop.\n \nIf anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please\ncontact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call\n713-279-1066.\n \n \n-- \nJaclyn Brandt\njbrandt@NeoSoft.com\n--\n"}, {"text": "From: snichols@adobe.com (Sherri Nichols)\nSubject: Re: OBP hurt by sac flies (was Re: HBP?

If that's correct, end of one point...\n\nGregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept.\nHis comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him,\nand are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member\nof a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways\nof the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum.\nThe big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West\nwe have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control\nand of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think\nthe majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say\n\"in agreement\") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the\nsecular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may\nhave chosen.\n\nWith that in mind, it not possible under secular law (\"legally\" as most\npeople would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once\nthey decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree\nthat there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there\nany secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past\ngroup member.\n\nA religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties\nof a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties\nin many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when\nthe enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person\n_in conflict with secular law_.\n\nThis is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular\nauthorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities.\nOutside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements\n_may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or\nmay not coincide with secular consequences (if any).\n\nRegards,\n\nDew\n-- \nDewey Henize Sys/Net admin RISC hardware (512) 891-8637 pager 928-7447 x 9637\n"}, {"text": "From: lilley@v5.cgu.mcc.ac.uk (Chris Lilley)\nSubject: Re: CorelDraw Bitmap to SCODAL\nLines: 21\nReply-To: C.C.Lilley@mcc.ac.uk\nOrganization: Computer Graphics Unit, MCC\n\n\nIn article <1r1rsiINNld@zephyr.grace.cri.nz>, srlnjal@grace.cri.nz writes:\n\n>Does anyone know of software that will allow\n>you to convert CorelDraw (.CDR) files\n>containing bitmaps to SCODAL, as this is the\n>only format our bureau's filmrecorder recognises.\n\nCorel Draw will do it; version 2 onwards.

Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person's\nself-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely\nmental/verbal level, and don't usually find expression in society except in an\nimpure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.
