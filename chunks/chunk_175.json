few days' correspondance that some\nbelieve that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial\nspace launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front\nlines see no reason why it should not.  The 'spaceport political publicity'\nreferred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico\ndid establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a\ncommercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of\ndual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic\nadvantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space\nto support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the\ntraditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick\nnon-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for\nlaunch, don't think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with\nthe MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm,\nbelievable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction\nto plug a space on a calendar.

I cannot\naccept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I\nurge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect\nthreats.\n\nPS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with\nthe search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that\njustice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967\nare not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called\npragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can\nnever be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace.\nIt is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the\nlaw, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not\nnormal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than\nWestern democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to\nmarry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have\ndrawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to\ncompensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy\nendure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day\nwill come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,\nin which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic\naffiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any\nmore. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their\ntraditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western\ndemocracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that\nmost\nAmerican Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed\nChristian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.\n\nI would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views\nand personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile\noutbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect\nJudaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.\n\nElias\n\n"}, {"text": "From: ckincy@cs.umr.edu (Charles Kincy)\nSubject: Re: Pgp, PEM, and RFC's (Was: Cryptography Patents)\nNntp-Posting-Host: next4.cs.umr.edu\nOrganization: University of Missouri - Rolla, Rolla, MO\nLines: 19\n\nIn article <1993Apr16.001321.3692@natasha.portal.com> bob@natasha.portal.com (Bob Cain) writes:\n\n>: I hope my cynicism is misplaced here.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\nJewish scriptures.\n\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\n\n\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\n\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\n\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\n\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\nHebrew! :-)\n\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\n\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \n\n\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\n\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\n\n\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\n\t-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely\n\n\t[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\n\t  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\n\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\ntranslator goes!)\n-- \nMichael L.

We ran into one of my relatives at the \nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\nnear the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What's going on?\" He says, \n\"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're \nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\n\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were \nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\nwere shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice \nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and \nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\n\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was \nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \nmicrodistrict.\n\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\n\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We're in School No. 33, we need to be \nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.\"\n\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\n\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \nout, we're here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that \nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That's what he did. He went down \nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\n\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\n\nIn the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, \nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\n\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \nthem.\n\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \nget the things any cheaper.\n\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his \nfeelings, of course.\n\n   April 8, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Dr. Noordewier has \nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \nto his current work in computational biology.\n\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\n\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \n National Laboratory) \n\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \ntechniques in this domain.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\n\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \nthe field.\n\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\n\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \nof word-based analyses.\n\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\n\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

But at the time of the\nRenaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre,\nor the focus of culture (hence \"humanism\"). This consciousness was\nalso secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the\npresent age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the\nsame time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.\nThis doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it\nbegan to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European\nsociety and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later\nstages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that\njustified\n them.\n\nThere was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \"economics\" -\nfrom the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of\ncreation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces\nand powers. There were denominational differences among the new\nworshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \"the free\nrein of the market mechanism\", while for others it was \"the\ndialectical forces of history\". But in both the capitalist West and\nthe socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of\nMammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who\nwere concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to\noppose what was happening and state their case.\n\nSteve\n\n--- GoldED 2.40\n"}, {"text": "From: ah301@yfn.ysu.edu (Jerry Sy)\nSubject: are Ford shop manuals good ?\nOrganization: St. Elizabeth Hospital, Youngstown, OH\nLines: 14\nReply-To: ah301@yfn.ysu.edu (Jerry Sy)\nNNTP-Posting-Host: yfn.ysu.edu\n\n\nI am planning on buying a repair manual for my ford taurus.

Sounds like a very cool program.\n\nTis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking \nmethod.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer\nin one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with \npyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite\nzone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes\naway.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional \nto the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body.\nThis could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.\n\nDancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their \nbodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.\n\nThe current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the\nAmiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera \ntrained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of\nview, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Events\ncan be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's been\nfun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy.\nStill, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances,\nyou can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights,\nand I don't have to build any electronics.  It's all done with lighting and\nvideo brightness and contrast adjustments.

The most\ncommon mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and\ntangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of\nthe coast.

However, in other respects, it was an easier problem\nsince the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the\nvirus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be\nrestricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,\nclean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real\nlife images.

I've \nbeen compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.\nI didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just \nlike I haven't read \"The Yeast Connection\").\n\nLet me just start by stating that the authors of the \"Cold Fusion\" papers of \nrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually \nleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a \nreview of the research notes of the \"cold fusion scientists\" actually \nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\n\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\nBut some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \noxidative damage in the body).\n\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \ncouldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really \nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \n\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\n\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation \nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \nseparate the fiction from the fact.\n\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing \nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\n\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \npart of the ageing process in humans).\n\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\n\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any \nbetter).\n\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \nI'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm \ngoing to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.\n\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's \ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his \nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\"\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \n\nI'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which \ndo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it \nbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?\nHow about quality of life guys?

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\n\nFor power:\n\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\n\nFor amplitude\n\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\n\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\n\nCommon references for audio are:\n\n\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\n\t0 dBV = 1 volt\n\n\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\n\t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)\n\n\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\nor moment.\n\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\n"}, {"text": "From: gwm@spl1.spl.loral.com (Gary W.

For one, your claim that everyone senses it\n#is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often.\n#And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it\n#is there unless evidence against it has been found.\n\nI have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an\nargument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the\nonly cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered\nby some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about\nfuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It's a good point, and I'm thinking\nabout it.\n# \n#Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,\n#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that\n#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,\n#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject\n#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological\n#claim, you have to prove it.\n\nNonsense.  My \"trick\" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so \ndoes almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore \nthat A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we\ncan establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and\nthat the resulting system of values is self-consistent.\n\nNow get this:  \"really is better\" is an idealisation, a fictional model,\nin the same sense that \"real material existence\" is a fictional model. It\nmay or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful\n_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist \n\"trick\", to wit:\n\nI feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person\nI ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,\nor if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,\nthen it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing\nmore can be said.  \n\nI say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority\nseeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to\nmaximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that \na supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the \nterrorist's - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical\nrelativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is\nsimply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival\nanything in the world of religion.\n\n#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not\n#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by\n#>#others.\n#>\n#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively\n#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this\n#>is possible.

While I was in grad school, a friend of mine got a \nsecurity clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine.\nHe found lots of articles which were public domain *removed* from the\nlocal engineering library (Madison Wisconsin).  So the lawyers sent him\nall over the states to other libraries to show that the information in\nthe article was already public.  What pissed everyone off was a local\nunderground paper went and published the article anyway (it had been\nprecensored by the feds, that's what this was all about) so the judge\ndeclared the case moot.\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in court.  From my\ndiscussions with several people familiar with the case, only 2 other\ntimes has this preemptive clause been used.  In every case the people\nsimply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the government *does* have precidence for\ndeclaring things classified *after* it has been published.  While I was\nworking on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the works\nand I developed a method for tracking particle beams.  It was good enough\nto classify, so I was no longer allowed to work on it.  A friend from\nCanada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute stripping\ncross sections, but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed\nto present his own paper at a conference!*.  He later published it in an\nopen journal without problems.\n\nWhen the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro.  The feds can do whatever\nthey want whenever they feel like it, and they will make up rules to let\nthemselves get away with it.  Since the mass media can't tell the difference\nbetween a joke and the real thing (like \"ranch appocolypse\" for the Waco\nmassacre) don't count on them to help spread the word about their loss\nof freedom.  The government *can* make strong crypto illegal.

It released\n>all churches from the use of the Latin Mass (unity) to allow them to\n>speak to the people in the common language (diversity). \n\nIn Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one\ncongregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in\neach city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they\nformed something of a stew, with different members having different\nheritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,\nsometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups\nin places such as the temple courts.\n\nNow in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a\ncommon language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin\nwas spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would\nmake sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common\nlanguage and not necessarily Latin.\n\nNaturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common\nlanguage.  In the first century church, there were probably many people\nin the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the\nmessage for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don't\nsee people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called\nPentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --\nbi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -\nsometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet\ntogether on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don't speak\nEnglish from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their\nnative tongue.  Neat idea, huh?\n\nNow, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,\nso sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-\nspeaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their\nnative language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times\nduring the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone\nwho speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also\nspeak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those\nmeetings.\n\nAs for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch\nwith their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep\nfriendships among their church relationships with people of many various\nnationalities.  \n\n>Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action?\n\nThe action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of\nLatin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second\nclipping of your article.\n\nHowever, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a\nculture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.\n\nI'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.\n\n>Rather I believe it has been enhanced, for Paul exhorts us to become as\n>one of them that we might reach them. Thus, if a person or group of\n>people feel more comfortable \"among their own\", shall we not give them a\n>place where they can feel comfortable [with their heritage] and still\n>l[ove God?] {[my guess - Aaron]}\n\nYou have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud\nof their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't.  Yet you have\nlargely isolated yourselves from having quality \"Christian\" friendships\noutside your nationality (and your denomination).\n\nWe shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their\nheritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church\nunity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.\n\n>This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite. \n\nIt sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going\nabout things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist\nEpiscopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.\n\nI understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such\ngroups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it's\nhard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one\nbody of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to\nmake it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,\nwould be taking the word \"African\" out of your denomination's name.  Then\nperhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the \"Methodist\nEpiscopal\" part also, and simply be part of \"the Church\".\n\n>With regard to inclusivity, I note tht your .sig emits from MIT.
