Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.\n \n  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk\n  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):\n  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX\n  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to\n  aid remailer use).\n\n  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu\n  -----------------------------\n    Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.\n    \n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu\n  -------------------------\n    Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus\n    <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.

Request information from above address.\n\n  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu \n  -----------------------------\n    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site\n    address for information.\n\n  Notes\n  =====\n  \n  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often\n    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues\n    are wholly unresolved.\n  \n  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP\n    software (see the question on cryptography). \n\n  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)\n    vary between sites.\n\n  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are\n    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.\n\n_____\n<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?\n\n  \n  Users\n  -----\n\n  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the\n    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.\n  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.\n  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on\n    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.\n  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.\n    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases\n    network traffic.\n  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this\n    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'\n    hierarchy is preferred.\n  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.\n    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for\n    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any\n    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even\n    future ones under the same handle.\n  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your\n    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by\n    sending anonymized mail to yourself.\n  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. \n    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.\n  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.\n  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.\n    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.\n  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large\n    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating\n    his hardware, all for your convenience.\n\n  Operators\n  ---------\n\n  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an\n    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and\n    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and\n    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and\n    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or\n    lassaiz-faire?\n  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate\n    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user\n    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user\n    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your\n    users trust you to protect them.\n  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations\n    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.\n    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke\n    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)\n  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.\n    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly\n    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with\n    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under\n    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.\n  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?\n    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is\n    your commitment to it?\n  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an\n    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. \n    Consult a lawyer about your liability.\n  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared\n    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you\n    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system\n    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.\n  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If\n    possible, query group readers.\n  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message\n    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure\n    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.\n  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from\n    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.\n\n  Readers\n  -------\n  \n  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason\n    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that\n    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail\n    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its\n    volume is heavy or increasing).\n  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters\n    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate\n    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.\n  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,\n    harassment, extortion, etc.\n  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they\n    offend you personally.\n  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the\n    idea of anonymity itself.\n  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings\n    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or\n    `conceivable' need exists.\n\n  References\n  ----------\n  \n  See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:\n\n  > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual\n  > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system\n  > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of\n  > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a\n  > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of\n  > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.\n\n_____\n<8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?\n\n  James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:\n\n  > Try putting this in your kill file:\n  >   \n  >   /Anon/h:j\n  >   /Anonymous/h:j\n  > \n  > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that\n  > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't\n  > kill followups. \n  \n  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask\n  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so\n  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common\n  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.\n  \n_____\n<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?\n\n  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for\n  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is\n  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion\n  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack\n  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was\n  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)\n  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided\n  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up\n  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous\n  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through\n  servers like there's no tomorrow.''\n  \n  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in\n  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system\n  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the\n  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,\n  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by\n  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended\n  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group\n  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was\n  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' \n  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an\n  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus\n  against it. \n\n  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to\n  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and\n  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of\n  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his\n  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to\n  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the\n  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was\n  created.''\n\n  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most\n  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on\n  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized\n  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine\n  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide\n  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.\n  \n  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet\n  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological\n  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).\n  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,\n  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than\n  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of\n  anonymity is also controversial.\n\n  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb\n  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate\n  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via\n  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been\n  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then\n  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a\n  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of\n  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating\n  through many newsgroups. \n  \n  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded\n  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''\n  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was\n  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of\n  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived\n  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries\n  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous\n  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his\n  detractors.\n\n  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal\n  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news\n  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire\n  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the\n  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is\n  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users\n  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a\n  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized\n  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due\n  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to\n  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.\n\n  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to\n  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste\n  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate\n  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages\n  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to\n  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several\n  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it\n  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5\n  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the\n  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he\n  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and\n  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.\n  \n  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by\n  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security\n  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is\n  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is\n  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon\n  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new\n  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple\n  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,\n  etc.\n\n  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.\n  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography\n  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of\n  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public\n  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several\n  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately\n  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the\n  software to the public domain.\n\n  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on\n  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and\n  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the\n  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,\n  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable\n  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in\n  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to\n  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing\n  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and\n  encryption.\n\n  See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting'' below and ``what\n  is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.\n  \n  (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste\n  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie\n  <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf@penet.fi> for\n  contributions here.)\n\n\n_____\n<8.5> What is the value of anonymity?\n\n  KONDARED@PURCCVM.BITNET:\n    \n  > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the\n  > content of one's message.

Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine,\nended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can\nbe added.

I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue \ntheir development. \n\nThe Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton \nis 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D\nwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about\nlaunch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which\nare probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things\nup pretty good) it seems feasible.

We do them regardless.  \n\nKent Sandvik responds:\n\n> Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you \n> have to feel guilty . . . \n\nI think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn't view\nguilt like our modern venacular colors it.   \n\n\"Feelings\" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of \nbeing guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a \nreaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the \nreaction.   Let me give you an example:\n\nHave you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a\nlittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really \ndidn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?\nAre you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You\nare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  \nFeelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word\n\"guilt\" as how a court uses it.\n\nJesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being\nimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do\nbad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our \nguilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. \nWe are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is\nnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us\nsinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a\nhuman being.  Guilty as charged.\n\n> and then there's this single personality that will save you from this\n> universal guilt feeling.\n\nYou can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you\nmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in\nthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the\nway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.\n\nOr two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself\nand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to\nsay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way \nJesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this \ncategory to some extent in their lives.\n\nJesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt\nfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he\nloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That\nisn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize \nthat this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.\nThat is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to \nhave your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.\nJesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present\nsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  \n\nGod is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into\na round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to\nchange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.\nGod has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in\nJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will\nmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very\nbeing--and us and God communicate with each through his\nunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For\nwith the divine nature living within us, we can now see\nour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With\nthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power\nto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives \nwithin us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before\nwe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now \nhave authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine \nnature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit\nis eternal.\n\nThe relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because\nit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to\nheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.\nRemember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he\nseparated the \"goats from the sheep\".   Many people in the\nlast day will ask him, \"Didn't I prophesy in your name and do\nmiracles, and do good things in your name?\"   And what did Jesus say?\n\"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.\"  That is the cornerstone of \nChristianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your \nrelationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will\nbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  \n\n> Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,\n> I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this\n> huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.\n\nGood.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you\nlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus\ntaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, \nin the common english venacular, \"feeling guilty\" has a\ndifferent meaning than the state of guilt.\n\n> This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain\n> personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain\n> religious doctrines. And if your personality type is \n> opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain\n> world view system.\n\nI believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,\na lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.\n\n> There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice\n> thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,\n> the shoulders feel far more relaxed!\n\nYes.  You have stated what Jesus said.  Remember?  \"Come to me,\ntake my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light.\"  A yoke\nis used to direct oxen to do work.  Once you have a relationship with \nJesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.

What exactly did I claim?\n     --------------------------------------------------\n    \"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\n  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"\n     --------------------------------------------------\n  \n    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're\n  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\n  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n  \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n  \nLater in the same post:\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\n\"inclined\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\n\nPreviously Awesley had written:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nPrompting me to write:\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nTo which Awesley replied:\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\n  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a\n  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.\n\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\nthat too is ludicrous.\n\nI wrote:\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n  it. \n\nAwesley relied:\n     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also\n  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\n\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \nArmy tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\ndo not.\n\nI wrote:\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\nAwesley wrote:\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\nhelped cover it up\"?\n\nI wrote:\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\nprefer\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe\n  that they did fire their guns.\n\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?\n\nAwesley concludes:\n     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\n  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the\n  account I cited.\n\nActually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as\nwell as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.\n\n--John L.

Indeed, as\nmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that\nChristians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if\nyou believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily\nbeing arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,\nbut he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.\n \n>So, I think that your position is:\n>The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our \n>interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out \n>what that truth is.\n>Did I get that right?\n\nNot quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*\ndetermine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible\nhuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The \ndistinction is subtle yet important.\n\nWhen a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results\nare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could\nhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,\nwithout sacrificing his convictions.\n\nNobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.\nThroughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know\nwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the\nright direction when he uttered, \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" yet we have not advanced\nmuch beyond that.\n\nDo you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that\nthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely\ncertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,\nyou have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all\npractical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with\nChristianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about\nabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability \nthat they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) \nabandon these absolutes.\n\n>What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending \n>absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we \n>can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?

This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren't.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition.\n\n--clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?

I don't feel compelled to\ndiscuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would\nnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would\nnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call\nto make.

Your 2F2 cap\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\nThe other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\nthe cold).\n\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\n\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\n\nCaveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\nconditions.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}, {"text": "From: jtrascap@nyx.cs.du.edu (Jim Trascapoulos)\nSubject: Re: Can I put a 1.44 floppy in an SE?\nOrganization: University of Denver, Dept. of Math & Comp.

I would\nseriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and\nmail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  \n\nFirst of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a\nvariety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give \nsuccinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of \nyou typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean \nit) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of \nindividuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing\n-- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  \n\nSecondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that\nphrases like \"What would convince you of the existence of God\" imply that I am\na seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.\nIn fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my\nuse of \"God\" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier \nthan just repeating \"a deity or higher power\" every time.  \n\nAlso, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like \"belief system\"\nalthough I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but\nare skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.\nThink of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases \nrequired to get the precise idea across.  \n\nLastly, thanks!

Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \n\n\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \n\n\nTo what extent do you feel you \"understand\" the universe through your beliefs?\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \nan explanatory method?  \n\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would\nconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the \nplausibility of God's existence, and so forth?

To what extent do you\nthink science has influenced your beliefs?

He even saw the whole shot, dammit.\n\nSure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against\nan explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with\na powerplay that was totally unnecessary.\n\n>Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\n>traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \n\nI disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. \nThe defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,\nNolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.\n\n>Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \n>five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \n>ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads. But I don't\n>think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \n>the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  \n\nThis most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\nas did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\nwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\nup the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\n\n>Roy is paid big money to \n>play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\nAnd Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because\nthat is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,\nwhen you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him\nfor most of the season.\n\n>Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\n>the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\n>article, if possible.\n\nThe Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory\ncomments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should\nthey read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \"Burnsian\" hockey to shut\ndown Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the \nextra 2.\n\nRed Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the\nseries 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?\nThe fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.\n\n>I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.

But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in\n>regardless.\n\nIf you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never\nhave been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work\nby Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the\npuck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\n\nYaska  ! yaska@eecg.toronto.edu !

But before I do, I want to \nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \na problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you \nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When \nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin \nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \nplan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as \nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \nregular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her \ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \nscheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\n\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \nminerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't \nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new \nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \nhandle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\nI'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \ndon't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \nthat I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a \nfew with an axe to grind.  That's life.\n\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \nchelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \nfor all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \ncome up there several times as a \"fat burner\".  Chromium is among the least \ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \ndo any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \nType II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there \nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is \nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \nconcerned\n\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \nthis possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \nfound in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the \nRBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\n\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \nanalysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny \nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\n\nHere's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \navailable(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\n\nWhat's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \nWhen he or she says, \"what in the world are you talking about\", just say, \nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook \nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \ntolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you \nvery much.\n\nMarty B.\n"}, {"text": "From: brian@lpl.arizona.edu (Brian Ceccarelli 602/621-9615)\nSubject: Re: Is it good that Jesus died?\nOrganization: Lunar & Planetary Laboratory, Tucson AZ.\nLines: 32\n\nIn article <C5yMIr.FnE@blaze.cs.jhu.edu> arromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee) writes:\n>You said everyone in the world.

He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\nisn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\na persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your\nquestion.\n\nJesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\nwe would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\nand my faith would be vanity.\n\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \"The\nworld hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\nneed a Saviour.\n\nAnd why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The\nworld cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows\nhim.\"  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge\nthat comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is\nvery convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.\nI pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of\nknowledge. I am not perfect either.
