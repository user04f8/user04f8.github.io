I don't think he's\nnearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP\nto save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release\nis slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming\nI can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.\n\nIf the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar\ncould be a hell of a CF.

The following are quotes of his speech: \n\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \nof Kuwait.'' \n\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \nafter Kuwait itself.'' \n\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's \nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.'' \n\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \n\n\nOrigins of Kuwait \n\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means \nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \nestablishment. \n\nThe 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait \nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. \n\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart \nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \n1750-1800. pub.1965. \n\nAl-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well \ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha's expedition against the \nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy \nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \nGulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) \n\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \ntried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \nGulf area. \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait \n\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \n\nAbdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \n\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \nwar against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \nthose who had signed it. \n\n\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \n\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \nUniversity, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \n\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \n\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on \nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \nterritory. \n\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \nfather's agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \nentitled to receive. \n\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \nhim the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's \ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.'' \n\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \nexplained above. However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman \nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \n\nThis is another article that testifies to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\n\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been \nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,'' \nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.'' \nThis description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain \ndegree it was run according to protocol. \n\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,'' \nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \nCazee's decision.'' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \narmy.'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \n\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other \nstates around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or \nill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and \nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.'' \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \n\nThis is another article that testifies to the \nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \nOttomans. \n\n\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,'' but \nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \n\nAfter Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \nTherefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any \nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \n\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the \nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \nsought refuge in Kuwait. \n\nProtection of refugees seeking political \nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait's independence \nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \nneighbors. \n\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \n\nAs to Kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \n\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \nMcGill University, Canada ] \n\n--- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the\n\"great judgement\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).\nI was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the\nchurch -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.

Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms \nthat my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?

In the\nmeantime, some believe that people \"sleep\" until the final\nresurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death\nto the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe\nthat souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then.\nThere are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.\n\nThe new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a\ndifferent \"technology\" than the current one, one which is not mortal.\n(Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus'\nresurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not\nsubject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"}, {"text": "Subject: Re: Need longer filenames\nFrom: maystonr@grace.cri.nz (Richard Mayston)\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Industrial Research Ltd., New Zealand.\nNNTP-Posting-Host: rmayston.grace.cri.nz\nLines: 10\n\n\n\nIn article <765461d518325t9@infoserv.com> hfeldman@infoserv.com (Howard MITCHell Feldman) writes:\n>In <1993Apr19.211044.28763@guinness.idbsu.edu>, lhighley@gozer.idbsu.edu (Larry Paul Highley)  wrote:\n>> \n>> \n>> Is there a utility out there that will let me use filenames longer than\n>> the standard 8.3 format.  \n>\nYep, it's called OS2!\n"}, {"text": "From: tedebear@leland.Stanford.EDU (Theodore Chen)\nSubject: Re: Toyota wagons\nOrganization: DSG, Stanford University, CA 94305, USA\nLines: 15\n\nIn article <1993Apr5.213032.26844@pmafire.inel.gov> russ@pmafire.inel.gov (Russ Brown) writes:\n>In article <1pq6bl$9rj@news.ysu.edu> ak296@yfn.ysu.edu (John R.

EDT\n\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please be seated.  I \nwant to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary \nRiley and with Senator Graham.  The three of us served as governors \ntogether during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to \nimprove our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to \nupgrade the standards in American education and to improve the \nquality of instruction our children were receiving.  \n\t     \n\t     There were no two governors whom I admired more during \nthat period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher \nof the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, \nafter all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been \npassed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes \ndown to what happens between the teacher and the students in the \nclassroom.\n\t     \n\t     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National \nTeacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one \nrecognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative \nscience programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's \nclassrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA \nfingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I \nmight add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's \nCapital.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high \nschool, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science \nprograms in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national \nand international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a \nfavored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, \nincluding those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach \nfor excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and \nwhat our country needs. \n\t     \n\t     Today, we know that a good future with high wages and \nrich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a \nlifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need \ncompetence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's \nwhy Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so \npleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these \naccomplishments. \n\t     \n\t     Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  \nI'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this \nApple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a \ngreat honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's \n2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have \nshown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to \nhelp redesign and improve our nation's schools.  \n\t     \n\t     We know that the quality of our children's education \nwill directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape \nin the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued \nsupport and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  \n(Applause.)\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome \nthe education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the \nnational education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize \nTracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself \na great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you \nthat the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award \nis to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to \npeople all across this country who give their lives to our children, \nall of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their \nbest to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of \nAmerica.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public \nservants.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n                                 END1:29 P.M.

Also, in most \ninstances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more \nperformance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.\nThe mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at \n2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of \nthe slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose\nto but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...\nAnyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,\nwhich is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario \nslip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full \nthrottle.\n\nJust remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or\nexhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may\nhave to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust\nsystem, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point\nwhich re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping\nprofile.\n\nTalk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if\nthey have used it on your particular bike.

Did you ever read newspaper at all?\n\n\n\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive.\"\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock.\"\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

But again it will not increase the speed\nof your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even\nif your original processor runs at a slower speed.\nThere is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX\non it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX\nor a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,\nthen you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and\nreplace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for\nboth normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip\ncosts $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the\n25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math\ncoprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the\nOverdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a\n20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally\nand 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is\nrated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.\n\nYou should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that\nadvertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop\naround as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for\na particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.\n\nLawrence Khoo\n\n-- \nkhoo@husc3.harvard.edu       Lawrence Khoo       Computer Consultant\nkhoo@haavelmo.harvard.edu    (617) 496-8992    Econ.

The stealth card is not a very good\ndos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local\nbus).

Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.\n\nP.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie:\ngames) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently\nscores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip\n(ie: stealth and actix cards.)

Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:\n\n02106@chopin.udel.edu or\n02106@ravel.udel.edu or\n02106@bach.udel.edu or\n02106@brahms.udel.edu\n\nNO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!\nLOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!\n\nShipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).\n\nFor all those who have bought comics from

However, who is at blame is another question.\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\n\n>There is a *probability* of \n>killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air, and \n>there is a *probability* of killing an innocent person when the\n>state administers a system of capital punishment.

Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\n\n>>And, driving will kill people, as will airlines, but people continue to do\n>>both.\n>Driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling\n>prisoners by Courts.

In fact,\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\nof innocents.\n\n>If our own driving kills someone else, then sure, there is a moral\n>issue.  I know at least one person who was involved in a fatal\n>accident, and they felt vey guilty afterwards.\n\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\non the road.  Again, the blame is on society.\n\n>>No I'm not.  This is what you said.  You were saying that if there were such\n>>a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed\n>>, it would still be the fault of the state, since it did the actual killing.\n>No, I just commented that the state does the killing.  It does not\n>depend on there being false witnesses.  How could it?  The state\n>does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes\n\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\n\n>>It is possible.  So, what are you trying to say, that capital punishment\n>>is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating\n>>the system?\n>I'm saying capital punishment is murder, period.  Not because of\n>this that and the other, but because it involves taking human life.\n>That's *my* definition of murder.  I make no appeals to dictionaries\n>or to \"objective\" morals.\n\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\nall such \"murders\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\n\n>If we, as a society, decide to murder someone, then we should say\n>that, and lists our reasons for doing so, and live with the moral\n>consequences.  We should not play word games and pretend that\n>murder isn't murder.  And that's *my* opinion about how society\n>ought to be run.\n\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\nexecution, is it?\n\n>>But, we were trying to discuss an objective moral system, or at least its\n>>possibilty.

I was showing\n>you that you didn't have one, because, for one thing, you were incapable\n>of defining the terms in it, for example, \"murder\".\n\nMurder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\ninnocent victim is.\n\n>>We're not talking about reading minds, we are just talking about knowing the\n>>truth.

The jury being *persuaded* beyond a serious\n>doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond\n>a serious doubt.\n\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\nwas moral or not.

That\nis, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.\n\n>Moreover, a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background\n>may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence\n>that you and I would laugh at.\n\nBut then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the\nconviction was unfair.\n\n>>But, would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds?

Your claim, which I have quoted\n>above is a claim about whether we can *know* it was fair, so as to\n>be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder.\n\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\npossible information), we can't always determine the difference in our\nflawed system.
