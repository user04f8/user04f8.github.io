A few points need to be clarified:\n\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\nconductor.  \n\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \n\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \n\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \n\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\npresent a shock hazard.  \n\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\n\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \n\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\n\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \n(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not\nit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\n\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\n\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\nit's primarily for lightning protection.\n\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\naluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \n\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\ngreenfield.\n\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\n\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\nGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be\nrenumbered though.) \n\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \n\nJohn\n-- \n*******************************************************************************\nJohn H.

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\nvia netmail...)\n\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \"Argumentum\nad silence-your-opponent-um\"?! I would have thought he would have\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\n\nThe issue that seems to be: \"Is the following an advertisement?\"\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\n\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \n\t*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\n\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\n\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\n\thad posted the address and subscription price of \"Newsweek\",\n\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\n\t\"proof\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\n\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\n\tbehold, \"poof\", there goes my account. This one had an\n\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\n\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\n\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\" or whatever; they\nonly get \"I don't like what that user is doing because...\".\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\n\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \"Thanks for\nthe info\" or \"Could you send me such and such?\" or \"Your posts are\nvery interesting... keep it up.\" and only a handfull of \"Go aways\". But,\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\"My name is Ted and\nand this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...\")\nNWO Indeed!\n\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\nwas just getting started.\n\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\non the net that are of \"interest\" to the government, and Ted sure seems\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he \"attends\"(?) is well\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\n\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I\nam longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY\nsoon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:\n\n\tA. J.

Only by not living out the\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\nrequires work on our part.\n\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\noneself about believing in the first place.  \n\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\ndoing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\nJesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.  \n\nJoe Fisher\n \n"}, {"text": "From: tim@kowari.cpsg.com.au (Timothy Fox)\nSubject: Re: Hot-key for Screen Saver?\nLines: 24\nNntp-Posting-Host: wpylie.cpsg.com.au\nOrganization: Computer Power Software Group Pty Ltd\n\nlouray@seas.gwu.edu (Michael Panayiotakis) writes:\n\n\n>Well, renaming screensavers (.scr) to .exe, and running them, as has\n>been pposted, (I haven't tried changing win.ini , but should have same\n>effect) shows me the \"setup\" dialog. box, butdoesn't enable the saver.\n\n>Mickey\n\nTry .exe /s  (/s for save screen, /c for config, defaults to /c)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe question is not \"If a tree falls in the forest and no one sees or hears,\ndid it fall?\" but rather \"How many koalas can that one tree take out???\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------tim@cpsg.com.au--\n--\n\n\nTim Fox\nCP Software Pty Ltd.

Whether one\nsees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with \nwhether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  \n\nJesus uses the word \"men\".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\nout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been\nexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't\nseen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.

Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians\nare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the\nLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,\nand they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far\nwe have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to\nknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants\nto know?

It is even sadder that the people who\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\ntheir downfall to death. \n\nAnd Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\n\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\nKoresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \n\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\nmother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\nright from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.\nThey wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\ncost them a lot.\n\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\ndidn't work with Jesus.  \n\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\nKoresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?\nWho was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what\nSatan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did\nnot Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not\nthe cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew\nthe real Christ was born in Bethlehem?

Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.\n\n \n     \n-- \n\tJim Gillogly\n\tTrewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:01\n"}, {"text": "From: jim.wray@yob.sccsi.com (Jim Wray)\nSubject: Re: With Friends Like The\nOrganization: Ye Olde Bailey BBS - Houston, TX - 713-520-1569\nLines: 27\nReply-To: jim.wray@yob.sccsi.com (Jim Wray)\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu\n\n\n Paul Prescod pontificating:\n\n PP>State.EDU (Cathy Smith) writes:\n\n PP>>     Libertarians oppose BOTH waiting periods AND background checks\n PP>>-- or ANY prerequisite for exercising rights that are supposed to\n PP>>be guaranteed.\n\n PP>Let me get this straight.

Instead, it looks like that\n>ill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies\nseize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that\nwe are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have\nto take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws\nand rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed\nthem to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has\nto be changed.\n\nAllowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug\ninformants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact\nwith the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are\nmotivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy\nway for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more\nincentive for the agencies to take property.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that\nClinton would have the \"plumbers\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his\nhenchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a\nleader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that\ncontrol and take more.\n\nWE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the\nequivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.

My sleep latency at night is also\npretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of\nbedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I\nwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because\nI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I\nwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.\n\n\tAnyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to\nget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;\nbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So\nI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly\nand felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually\nfelt refreshed the next morning.\n\n\tSo,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and\nexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am\npresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The\nantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought\nsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't\nnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about\n1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research\nseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest\nsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic\nform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good\ndosage level to try.\n\n\tFor other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have\nan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry\neyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did\nguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some\nchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I\nwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)\n\n\tAnyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of\nantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use\n(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by\nmillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be\na serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,\nwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have\ntried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to\nlower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some\nkind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in\nany other advice for helping my problem.

The FBI and\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\nstupidity and lies.    \n\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\n\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \nwondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\nFirst, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\ndidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\nit.\n\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\n\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\nsaid:\n\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise\nDavid Koresh.\"\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\npart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.
