I'd like to give some feedback based on\nreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode\nand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does\nis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes\nsense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different\ndirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its\nreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.\n\nI have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case\nthere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I\npassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then\nthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With\nother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.\nBut with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there\nwas another trap.  And there was!\n\nOn other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from\na true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator\nchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where\nthe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the \nplace.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector\nthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the\ncar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would\nhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar\ntrap when there was none.\n\nI've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features\nto be useful and not gimmicks.\n\n                                       -Barry\n-- \n-----                                                                   --------\nBarry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.com\nChelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319\nChelmsford, MA                                                 \n"}, {"text": "From: cek@sdc.boeing.com (Conrad Kimball)\nSubject: Re: Problem with R4 release\nOrganization: Boeing Computer Services, Seattle, WA\nLines: 48\nNntp-Posting-Host: zulu\n\nIn article <MCGARY.93May12172612@mojo.intellection.com>, mcgary@intellection.com (Mike McGary) writes:\n|> In article <1sr3klINNauq@news.u.washington.edu> pramod@stein.u.washington.edu (Pramod Mahadev) writes:\n|> \n|> >   ld: Unidentified external symbol\n|> >      _get_wmShellWidgetclass\n|> >      _get_applicationshellwidgetclass\n|> >\n|> >     I use -lXaw -lXmu -lXext -lX11 -lXt not in this order but in a proper order\n|> >\n|> >   I am wondering if there has to be some changes in my link libraries or should\n|> >   i include some more libraries.\n|> >\n|> >   ANy help in this matter will be very useful and highly appreciated\n|> >\n|> \n|> We get this too.

I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would\nlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.\n\nI'm considering two basic options:\n\n1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.

Advantages include the fact\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\n\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.

Spent more than an\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \nit back... hmmm...).\n\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\n\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\nAt least it now sits level..\n\n-- \n\nE.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\nSodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says:\n\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\n\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\n\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\ndon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\n\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\nachieve a good result.\n\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\nexpect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen said:\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\n\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\n\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\nthought.\n\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\n\nI once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He said:\n\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n   and of Judaism.\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n   the Promised Land.\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n   of all humans everywhere.\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n   saved them.\n\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\n   memorable line of the evening.\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n   Epiphanes....\n\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\nstate of Israel.\n\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\nbrought about.\n\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\nnone the less valid).\n\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\n\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\n\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\ninstruments of God's will?\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n"}, {"text": "From: injc@sun.rz.tu-clausthal.de (Joerg Czeranski)\nSubject: Re: Off the shelf cheap DES keyseach machine (Was: Re: Corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip)\nOrganization: Techn.

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.\n\ndvb\n"}, {"text": "From: shiva@leland.Stanford.EDU (Matt Jacobson)\nSubject: NDW Norton Desktop for Windows\nOrganization: DSG, Stanford University, CA 94305, USA\nLines: 19\n\n\nI have an IBM and run Windows 3.1.

Even if\n  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the\n  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which\n  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the\n  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the\n  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution\n  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews\n  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that\n  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that\n  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and\n  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the\n  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and\n  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection\n  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,\n  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>\n\n\n  page 21:\n\n  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official\n  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi\n  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and\n  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation\n  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from\n  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two\n  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom\n  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European\n  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.\n  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant\n  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of\n  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who\n  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)\n\n\n  page 41:\n\n <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were\n firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them\n and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians\n of Europe.\n\n Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is\n also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews\n as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.\n Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians\n representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European\n sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition\n it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their\n sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who\n regularly reported to the Ottomans.\n\n There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans\n in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances\n of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited\n instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the\n early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy\n for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman\n document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some\n Greek towns...>>\n\n page 43:\n\n  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally\n accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,\n and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of\n the situation.>>\n\n\n page 46:\n\n <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not\n particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common\n interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition\n which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If\n there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between\n religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was\n that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with\n the Orthodox.>>\n\n page 46:\n\n <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context\n during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of\n interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed\n Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already\n existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish\n response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian\n countries to Ottoman domains.>>\n\n page 151:\n\n  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the\n  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would\n  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,\n  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and\n  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions\n  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the\n  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>\n\n  page 161:\n\n  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success\n  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success\n  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both\n  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough\n  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success\n  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve\n  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear\n  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable\n  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.\n  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their\n  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the\n  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\n  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>\n\n\n(*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:\n\n  page 32:\n\n  <<Your cries and sobs reached us.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\nour lives into \"before\" and ''after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\nlosses and everything that happened.\n\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \nthose who didn't.\n\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was\nnear and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\n\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\nlike it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a \nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\n\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \nexpected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out \nof the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\"\n\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \nme. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \nwas thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to \nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\nexcited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They \ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \nroom. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\n\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, \nthey don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \nyour children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your \nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people \namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm \na teacher.\n\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \nhim in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \nbut a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were \ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \nMamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I'm old enough to \nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he's being held, \nMamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, \nwho's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \nmustn't do it. She said, \"Come on, let's straighten this out, without \nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \ncame here to kill them.\"\n\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \ndidn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\n\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\ndid to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \nthey beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but \ndidn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \nkicking her, using anything they could find.\n\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, \njust didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let's take her \noutside.\"\n\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \nweren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't \nafraid of what would happen to them.\n\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \nwith blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \nI were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm \nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold \na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, \nand I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\n\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\nhe's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \nI felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I \njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the \nground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\n\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't \nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth \nliving.\n\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \nalthough, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that \nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \nforget it.\n\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\n\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to \nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it \nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \nfrom the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, \n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\n\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even \nremember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\nthere by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell \nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad \nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\n\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \nneighbors.\n\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\n \nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \nsure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone \nsaid, \"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a \nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember\nwhose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \tI having opened my \neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \nbeen beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only \nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \nI can't remember anything more.\n\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot \nabout him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\nif he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \nUfa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \nall out later.\n\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \nof the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is \nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \ndidn't want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \nentirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting \nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. \nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the \ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone \nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.\n\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's \nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm \na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, \nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. \nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\n\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \nand money in your apartment we'll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \nover and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one \nanother right then.\n\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, \nhalfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, \nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\n\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \nthreshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\n\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \nwas already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \nthat all of that would die with me.\n\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \ndidn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\nI would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in \nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \nor not. He said, \"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\" In the third \nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \nalready taken the other.\n\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\n\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\nThat's just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I'll drive\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\nand nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \nThat's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\n\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. \nMarina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\n\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the \nneighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're \nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\n\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What's the mat-\nter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \nhe couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \ntold him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\ngood terms with them.\n\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \nopened the door and immediately said, \"I'm an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \nLet her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows\nabout this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a \nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid \nto go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see \nwho's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, \nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \nstill there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\n\nI went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \ndon't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were \nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport \njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \nAnd again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to \nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know \nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \nhad never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on \nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. \nI tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in \nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\n\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\nchildren's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. \nAll these years I've been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \n\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and\nleft.\n\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \nvery often.\n\n\t\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Many young adults come there to search for meaning in \ntheir life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a \nsharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a \nmonthly \"Johannine Hour\" which will be posted at the beginning of each \nmonth. A \"Johannine hour\" involves a short commentary on a given Bible \npassage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that \nmay arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be \nposted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less \nin polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another \nto deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own \nlife-journey.\n\nThe idea of \"Johannine hours\" was born in Taize as a simple response\nto all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the\nmidst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often\nimpossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but\neveryone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit\nquietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,\nwe can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of\nChrist.\n\nDuring the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we \nunderstand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, \nwe find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to \ncommunicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening \nthem with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought \nus joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.\n\nPerhaps those who read and think about the \"Johannine Hours\" in this\nnewsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.\n\nThe important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the\npersonal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect\nof sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:\n=================================\n\nThe following provides some background information on the life and\nvocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.\n\n\"A PARABLE OF COMMUNION\": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of\nWorld War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost\nabandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring\ntogether a monastic community which would live out \"a parable of\ncommunity\", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of\nthe time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal\nrefugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.\n\nAN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent the\nfirst two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,\nseven brothers committed themselves together to common life and\ncelibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each\none making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.\nToday, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant\nbackgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are\nliving in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North\nand South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for\nthemselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no\ncapital. The brothers earn their living and share with others\nentirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an\ninternational Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live\nin the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming\npeople in Taize.\n\nTAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and\nless young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since\n1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have\nthus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental\nmeetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year\nand they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any\none week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore\nthe roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner\nlife and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to\n6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and\neverybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church\nof Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too\nsmall.\n\n\"A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH\" The community has never wanted to\ncreate a \"movement\" around itself. Instead, people are called to\ncommit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,\ntheir city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created\nwhat it calls \"a pilgrimage of trust on earth\". At the end of each\nyear, the pilgrimage has a \"European meeting\" which brings together\ntens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for\nseveral days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia\nand in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open\nletter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the\npoor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages\nand provide themes for reflexion for the following year.\n\nNOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in \n       news.groups.\n\nFor any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk\n\n               brother.roy@almac.co.uk\n-- \n . 1st 1.10b #332 .

You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\n>you can think of to do so.\n\nI can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for \nhomosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of \nbestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask \nthis gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences?  \nWhat happened to \"No doubt I am free to do anything\"?  I think you have a \nserious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between \nhomosexuality and bestiality as \"slimey\" and \"sleazy\", you are making an \nimplicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, \nunnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about \nhomosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any \nsincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even \nhave their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them \nall of being mere \"jokers\"?\n\nI notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only \nBiblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical \nprohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament \npassages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none \nthat condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian \nhomosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any \"clear\" New Testament \nstatements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian \nzoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament \nmakes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?\n\nI am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically \nacceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply \nthe same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well.  If \nthe arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual \npreferences as well, I'm going to apply them and see what comes up.  I'm not \ntrying to \"torpedo a serious issue\" by using what you label \"a ridiculous \njoke\".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines \nfor Christian sexuality, and I don't think such a question is \"irrelevant\" in a \ngroup called \"soc.religion.christian\".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and \nbestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good \nprecedent for doing the same.\n\n>Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\n>the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\n>love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\n>ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\n>in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\n\nI don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a \nside issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging \npeople to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine \nwhether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New \nTestament that \"God has joined together\" heterosexual couples, and that the \nmarriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual \nintercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under \nthe Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards \nof defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the \nsexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don't think it's \nright to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to \nChristians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't.  \nThat was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different \nexamples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong \nto apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. \n\n>Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\n>corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\n>old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\n>even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\n>the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\n>manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\n>emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\n>taking the trouble to find out what it is.\n\nIt was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don't \nget all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual \norientation; I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar \nattitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with \nchild abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of \"clear\" NT \ncondemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation \n(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on \nalt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.\n\n>Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\n>WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\n>condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN\n>to BEFORE you start your condemnations?

I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you \nyourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find \nbestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in \nconnection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply \nall the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply \nthem to homosexuals?\n\nIs it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at \nthe thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of \nhomosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially \nunacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  \nDo you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual \nmorality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible \ncondemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality \nthan it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality \nwith homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer \nthis question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many \npeople feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.\n\nAlso please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely \npointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that \nthe Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think \nadultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love \nmy neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and \nunmentionable, are you disobeying \"repeated orders not to judge or condemn \nothers\"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you \nand judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same \noffense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible \nbrands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?\n\n>For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\n>evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\n>rejected.

If you mean that Jesus \nis the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I \nagree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our \nsalvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, \nand we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ's grace mean that those \nwho refer to sin as \"sin\" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking \nin general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible \ncalls something \"sin\", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it \nsin too.\n\nAs applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on \nChristian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible \nsays on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every \nverse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and \"unclear\" at best.  \nThe most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some \ndispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as \ncondemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most \npositive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that \nsome verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That's it.  Jesus declared all foods \nclean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to \nkeep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from \nbeing an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian \npractice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination \nthat defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you \nhave some verses which are at best \"not clear\" but which some people believe \n*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum \ntotal of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.\n\nI can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything \nsimple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and \nthose-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your \ncase as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don't believe it says \nanything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving \none another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is \nit?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for \nChristians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  \nTherefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  \nEven if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still \nleft with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about \nhomosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who \nare under the law and those who are not.\n\n- Mark\n\n\n[Actually I don't think the reaction to the comparision with\nbestiality is based on bestialophobia.  I think what he regards as\nslimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and\nbestiality.  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical\napproach to the Law.  They regard all of Lev as not binding on\nChristians.  The argument is that there's no way in the text to\nseparate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics.  This\ndoes not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nor\ndoes it mean that they accept bestiality.  It simply means that their\nsexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not from\nLev.  --clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: johnsd2@rpi.edu (Dan Johnson)\nSubject: Re: \"Accepting Jeesus in your heart...\"\nReply-To: johnsd2@rpi.edu\nOrganization: not Sun Microsystems\nLines: 45\n\nIn article 29201@athos.rutgers.edu, seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.)

This will probably\ninvolve defining \"spritual needs\" (is it not that clear) and\nshowing that such things exist and how they can be filled.\n\nAnnother tack you might take is to say that \"fulfilling spiritual\nneeds\" means \"acknowledging a \"higher power\" of some sort, then\nshow that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise\nidentical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you,\nbut as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping\none crutch for annother.
