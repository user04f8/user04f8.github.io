The shock\nsensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have\non my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,\nbut any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It\nworks great.\n\n> \n> What worries me is the hood and hatch.

You can adjust\nit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without\nsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the\nSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false\nalarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has\nbeen activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's\ncause and it was not a false alarm.\n> \n> I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl\n> underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm.\n> \nI guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight\nin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are\nsupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't\nhave one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm\nwon't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.\n\n> Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that\n> supposedly detects people approcahing the car....\n> \nThis is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at\nthis feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want\nto get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so\nthat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that\nwould trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.\nI don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you\nleave the top down on.\n\nAvoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to\npeople as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would\ntaunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. \nThe owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.\n> \n> I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems\n> and about the viper in general.\n> \nI am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune\nit to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable\nthe chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the\nalarm is armed/disarmed.  \n\nI like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine\nflashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be\ncareful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your\nkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are\nmeticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.\n> The car is an 89 Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape!\n> \n> \n> Ron Garnett\n> \n\nI looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but\nmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. \nThe shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)\nthan the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good\nvalue for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. \nExcept maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. \nAnyone know where we can get one of those installed?

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll\ntry to get better.\n\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\n\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\nhis set of excuses.  \n\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\n\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see\nthe dialog:\n\n\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \n\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\n\nBK:  \"No.\"\n\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\n     the oncoming truck.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\n\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\n\nBK:  \"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\n\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\n\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\n\n\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \n\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\n\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\nBrian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \n\nThank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.

If they needed\nto assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the\nfederal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type\nassaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the\ntactical and legal parts of it.

It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself\nhave never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience\nof that visit and of an observation of \"SQUILDLY\" behavior by other \ncustomers and/or sales personel:\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nI ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into \"cruiser\" type bikes. My\nfriend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He\nwanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer\nthat sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. \n\nThe place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few \nIntruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.\n\nWell the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I \nmoseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.\nI could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),\nbut I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured\nto each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs\nfirmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the \"hormone gang\"\ntalking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big\ndeal.\n\nHere is the part that concerned me. The \"HG\" and those shop personel that were\nnot busy with customers went back out, where said \"HG\" members fired up their\nrides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,\none decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.\n\nSQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager\nnot only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they\nwere betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely\nas he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her\n\"pilot\" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers\ncould be heard as well as felt.\n\nI felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those\nin cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and\ndamning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little\nuncomfortable and we left. \n\nI will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my\nanger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open\nmind and doesn't associate me with them. \n\nBTW, I can't afford a new bike.....\n"}, {"text": "From: azoghlin@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Very Old Freshman (VOF))\nSubject: Re: The [secret] source of that announcement\nDistribution: inet\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 12\n\nbear@tigger.cs.Colorado.EDU (Bear Giles) writes:\n>I wish them luck in figuring out who \"I\" am based on that information.\n\n>(They can probably figure out I'm liberal, with a technical degree\n>but humanistic interests, from a common thread throughout my posts.\n>But that describes a fair portion of the users of Internet).\n\nSounds like you are the brother of sibble to me. <hey that wasn't\nnice> {Oh shut up, I'm posting now} [Both of you pipe down, or I\nwill take control of the arms and sock you in the mouth]\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: well5173@mach1.wlu.ca (wells dana)\nSubject: Re: Anyone heard of _DELTREE_?\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nOrganization: Wilfrid Laurier University\nDistribution: na\nLines: 8\n\nIt is the new command with Dos 6 that allows you to erase your directory and\nall the files in it, without first erasing the individual files.\n\n-- \n     -------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |Dana Wells, BA                  |    _#_  Yes, Another MALE Dana |  \n     |Wilfrid Laurier U, Waterloo, ON |   /. .\\    Urban Geographers   |  \n     |well5173@mach1.wlu.ca           |   \\_*_/     Plan-It Better!    |\n"}, {"text": "From: luriem@alleg.edu The Liberalizer (Michael Lurie)\nSubject: Re: Joe Robbie Stadium \"NOT FOR BASEBALL\"\nArticle-I.D.: alleg.1993Apr6.210510.2943\nOrganization: Allegheny College\nLines: 10\n\nIn article <1993Apr6.025027.4846@oswego.Oswego.EDU> iacs3650@Oswego.EDU  \n(Kevin Mundstock) writes:\n> Did anyone notice the words \"NOT FOR BASEBALL\" printed on the picture\n> of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA\n> Today?

Perhaps you heard about\nanti-trust in the business world.\n\nSince we are debating the legality of a commercial\ntransaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines\nand ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says\nthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of\ninvesting, you can not acquire a large number of those\nshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so\nonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,\nthe Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some\ndesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.\nThey were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.\n\nThe palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the\nold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /\nmulti-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours\nwas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair\nmarket value, etc... They did not know they were victims of\nan international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist\nmyself, but this one is hard to dismiss).\n\n\n>>As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace, maybe.\n>>However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish\n>>state, where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of\n>>the land.

I don't want to get\non a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its\nOK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is\na nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it\nhas an integer square root.\n\n>>Those palestinians who stayed, actually stayed despite of what \n>>happened, and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless\n>>and ineffective minority.\n>>If I were wrong, you'd have Israel recall all the\n>>palestinian refugees (we're talking millions).

My experience tells me that\nevery palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in\nPalestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an\nescape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with\nyou. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,\njust being rethorical.\n\n\n>>Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it\n>>had to maintain a democratic facade (to keep the western aid\n>>flowing).\n\n>\tIsrael got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It\n>still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how\n>is granting citizenship a facade?\n\nDon't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic\nwithin the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).\nIsrael probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic\ncleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the\ninternational community, or make the best out of a no win\ncondition: show the world how good Israel is towards the\n'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the\narab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So\nyes, they're there. But as a community with history and\nroots, its dead.\n\n>>\tTell me something, Sam.  What makes land \"arab?\"\n\n>How shall I explain, Its a contract between the man and the\n>land.

Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.

This always\nscrews up the line I've picked out.\n\nHere's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and\n\t  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON'T DRINK SOAP!

So if we can \njust hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably \nwill work out a lot better. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If you'll give us the time.  That's the problem.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We've got a two-minute warning problem.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, it is a problem.  It's about \n1:15 p.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The teacher would walk off and then --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's -- I'm just trying \nto work this out here.  I think that's the best way to handle it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can I ask you a series of questions about the way \nthe President handled the notifications yesterday? \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice \nDepartment about who would come out and discuss what had happened in \nWaco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why don't we just take a step even \nfarther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on \nthe contact between the Justice Department and the White House.  As \nyou know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney \nGeneral on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  They had a good discussion, \nabout 15 minutes.  The Attorney General informed the President of \nwhat she wanted to do.  He raised no objections.  Obviously, she had \nthe implicit authority from the President to go forward.  He raised \nno objections.  She went forward.  They had a discussion of a general \nnature about the incident.\n\t     \n\t     Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the \nPresident spoke with the Attorney General again.  They had a brief \ndiscussion over what was happening in Waco.  As you know, this was \nbefore the fire broke out at the compound.  And I think that was why \nthere was some -- just some confusion.  I think that she was \nconfusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day \nwhen they spoke.  \n\t     \n\t     Then there was a number of contacts at a number of \ndifferent levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the \nJustice Department and the White House.  They were informing us of \n\f\ntheir decisions, what they would like to do.  There was an FBI \nbriefing in Waco.  The Attorney General had her press conference.  \nThe President then issued a statement after that.\n\t     \n\t     Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair \namount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in \nWaco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the \nPresident say anything until we had a much better sense of what was \nactually happening on the ground.  Once we were fairly clear on what \nwas happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a \nstatement.  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday \nevening.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At what hour was that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.  I believe it \nwas after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.  He took a tour of \nthe Holocaust Museum last night.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And he went out to dinner.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.  Yes, he went to \ndinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.  I \ndon't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.  And he \njust said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to \ntell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, \nthat she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try \nand get some sleep.  He then, again, spoke with her this morning \nabout the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this \nafternoon.  As you know, the President will have an announcement to \nmake at 1:15.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last \nnight, or this morning?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Webb Hubbell is the general White \nHouse Liaison and several people talked to Webb.  The Attorney \nGeneral was running the operation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that \nshe had done a good job?  Or he just tell her that she should get \nsome sleep?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good \njob -- I don't know the exact words.  I think that sounds right.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I mean, sleep well has implications as to \nconscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think everybody \nfeels badly when you have a situation when --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I understand that, but whether the issue of blame \nis brought up in that phraseology.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it \nhas nothing to do with that.  The spirit with which it was offered \nwas that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General \nhad to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation \nyesterday.  And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best \nas she could and --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, does he think it was mishandled?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm \nwords to a friend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he think the situation was mishandled?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In retrospect?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President stands  by the \ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the \nAttorney General.  He accepts full responsibility.  At the same time, \nI think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what \nexactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can \nto make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen \nagain, or at least we know how to handle it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How much did he know about what she was going to go \nahead with?  I know that she made the case to him -- explained --\noutlined the case for action.  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely \nwhat action?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was specific \noperational detail as to what was going to happen.  I think that they \nhad a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of \naction.  I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just \ntrying to get a sense of how things were considered.  But it wasn't \nminute-by-minute detail of how the operation --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, was it, \"we are going in.\"  Is it, \"we're \ngoing to use tear gas\"?  I mean, what?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe it was that we want to go \nin and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in \nthe compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement \nout.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was there ever a conscious political \ndecision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President \nfrom --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, we were in \nclose contact with the Justice Department.  The President accepts \nresponsibility for this.  At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted \nto be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as \nwe could be on how the decisions were made.  It is the responsibility \nof those on the ground to make recommendations.  The Attorney General \nhas operational control over this.  The President obviously accepts \nresponsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney \nGeneral.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, there was a report on the television today \n-- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult \nhad said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire \nand not themselves.  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of \na smashing into the building  where the fire broke out.  And my \nquestion is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All the evidence we have is that \nthis fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound \n-- every bit of evidence we have.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do \nthis now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible \nconsequences of either death or injury?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific \nquestions.  He had general questions about how the decision was going \nabout being made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Those are general questions and did he ask \ngenerally, why now?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he asked, have you \nconsidered all of the consequences; have you considered the \nrecommendations?  I don't know if he asked the question, \"why now?  \"  \nI don't know if he asked that specific question.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff \nthat's come out since then about the information provided by the \nlistening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much \nspecific detail they got into.  I know that she generally said that \nthis is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the \ndecision she's prepared to make.  It's based on the recommendations \nshe was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of \nthose involved.  Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was \nbeyond that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the President's understanding why \nyesterday?  One of the people who went into the compound a couple \nweeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may \nhave told law enforcement people something that precipitated this \naction.  Why yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.  I \nthink what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has \nsaid.  There were indications that those inside the compound were at \nsome danger.  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and \nit was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that \nthe situation was not going to get any better at all.  \n\t     \n\t     There was also some concern over the vulnerability of \nthe agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that \nthese teams normally have to work.  And as the Attorney General has \nsaid, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have \nreplacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a \nconcern over the safety.  \n\t     \n\t     All of these factors came into play.  They also \nconsidered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts \non David Koresh and those in the compound.  I would just go back to \nwhat the Attorney General has said.  You have to make the best \njudgment you can, given the information you have at the time.  They \ndid.  Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.  It's a terribly \nunfortunate situation.  We all wish it could have turned out \ndifferently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were \nmade at the time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, when did the President know that they were \ngoing to use tear gas?  Was it before the assault on the compound?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.  I don't believe \nhe was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.  \nI just don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Along that point, George, can you say whether the \nplan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way \nto end the standoff one way or the other yesterday?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was presented as a way \nto increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, \nas a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't \npresented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this \nrelevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet \nReno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I think he's satisfied that \nthey were acting on the best advice and the best information they \nhad, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was there a 12-hour gap between \nconversations between the President and the Attorney General?  In \nother words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again \nuntil Clinton got back from dinner at --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's likely, yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he call her?  What time did she call?  Was \nthere a gap between when she called him?  I mean, was he at dinner \nwhen she called and --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.  I think he called her \nlast night.  I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last \nnight.  He just wanted to talk to her.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     what was going on?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What do you know about the situation now?  Everyone \nhas perished who -- except eight or nine?  And do you know any of the \nother details?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than \nthe FBI reported in Waco.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what \nis going on?  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was \nhe keeping track of what was going on here?  I mean, with all due \nrespect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  There was also -- as I said, \nseveral people in the White House were in constant contact with their \ncounterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who were those contacts?  I mean, was it Mack \nMcLarty, Webb Hubbell?  How was the President being kept informed?  \nThat's not a --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with \nWebb.  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.  I \nbelieve Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.  \nEither Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during \nthe day with people at the Justice Department.  We were fully briefed \nand fully informed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We were told this morning that the President may \nhave spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb.  Do you \nknow if that's true or not?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may \nhave.  I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance \nthat he may have at some point.  I don't believe he did.  I think \nthat the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with \n\f\nthe Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the \nAttorney General.  But the White House was fully informed on a \nminute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was \nhappening at the Justice Department.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, who decided that the briefing would be done \nby the Attorney General?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you or did the White House communications staff \n-- were you ever involved with that decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  We were told about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-\nLehrer and all that stuff?  Was that part of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     there was no advice from the White House at all \nabout her -- she was on all night, all day.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction \nto the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally \nthe White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not \nhaving him appear as personally saying anything?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at \nall.  As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of \nthe information at hand.  The President is also making a statement \ntoday.  The President made a statement yesterday morning.  The \nPresident has been fully involved --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After this turned into less than a successful \noperation, the only statement from the President was what was on \npaper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to \nthe major facts in this.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was the first statement \nfrom the President, not the only statement from the President, number \none.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After the --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.  \nNumber two, the Attorney General --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He gave a statement early in the morning when the \nthing was starting to move --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  And he gave one yesterday \nand he's giving one today.  Now, the second point --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It just happens this was a written statement with \nno sort of communications policy or thought process involved?  It was \nthe President wants to put out a written statement?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Knowing what we knew at the time, \nwe thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was \nappropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and \nexpressing his support for the Attorney General's --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do \nsomething?\n\f\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.  \nThat is his statement.  It's a statement under his name.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't \nsay the President took full responsibility for what happened --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I certainly did.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, what you said was --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I \nmean, unless I miss something --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd love to.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     Janet Reno said that she took full \nresponsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI \n--\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the President takes \nresponsibility.  Absolutely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Took responsibility -- all right.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Considering how little was known about what was \ngoing on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why \nis Washington calling this a mass suicide?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that knowing what we \nknow now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and \nduring, it is painfully clear that those there were under his \ncontrol.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are \nconcerned, though, isn't it, George?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely \ndifferent matter.  I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear \nresponsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely.  But he \nclearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, \nand that's what he did.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You're still operating completely on assumption, \nright?  I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that \nthis was mass suicide.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We have evidence that those inside \nthe compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of \nthose inside.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I didn't quite hear it.  This might be Ann's \nquestion, I didn't quite hear it.  But at what time did Clinton \nhimself put out a statement on this?  I know Dee Dee said some stuff \non this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Right after the evening news went on the air?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the \ninformation.  We were working on it.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q \t  Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the \ninvestigation the President is going to announce is going to be an \nadministration-run investigation.  Why not have someone from the \noutside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a \npolitical stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have \nalready been --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that clearly the ATF and \nthe Justice Department will bear responsibility for the \ninvestigation.  That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations \nlike this, having some sort of independent involvement as well.  But \nit will be run by the Treasury and Justice. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you confident that you will not have any \nproblem getting --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, did the President reach out to anybody else \nto get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno?  And who else in the \nWhite House sat in on that meeting?  Anyone else from Justice?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was \nthere at the time.  It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a \nmeeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sunday.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.  It was a phone call, it \nwasn't a meeting.  I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but \nbeyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, you said that in that phone call, she said \nthat we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force \nhim out.  What did he think she was talking about?  If he didn't know \nabout tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was approving an action \nto increase the pressure on --\n\t     \n\t     q\bQ\t   It didn't matter how she did that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  I mean --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What information did he have in terms of how this \nwould proceed?  Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute-\nby-minute, but in a general sense --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he knew that this was the \nrecommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the \nlaw enforcement agencies.  I just don't know --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is \"this\" -- when you say that \"this\" was the \nrecommendation --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The action to increase pressure.  I \ndon't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be \ntold that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a \nhole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they \nwere moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure.  I \njust don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best \nadvice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was -- he did ask some general \nquestions about the advice and recommendation he gave.  At the same \ntime -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous \nrecommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, it would seem that this question about just \nexactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of \nthe operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere.  Can you \ntake that question and --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     get the answer and come back to us with all of \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a \nstrategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a \nwritten statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be \non all of these television broadcasts?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.  Never.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And you never called the Justice Department and \nsaid to anyone or Janet Reno, \"you're the one who needs to be out \nfront explaining this\"?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It just happened that way that she was the \nspokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She made a decision as Attorney \nGeneral that it was important for her as the operational officer in \ncharge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the \nquestions on this tragic incident.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  She had no guidance from the White House at all?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you \ndidn't object, but did you suggest it?  Was this a plan --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. Absolutely not.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     a strategy?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she clear it?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did she notify you?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What happened to this great detailed process you \nhave for clearing and talking to every public information officer and \nevery -- under every rock and every place in government that \nsomething as major as this could have occurred without a discussion \nbetween you and the public information people at least at the Justice \nDepartment?\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General made the \ndecision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward.  It seemed \nlike a good decision.  It was a good decision.  She did a good job.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how \nyou would handle it?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You wouldn't change a thing if --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The way the White House handled any part of it -- \nfrom start to finish.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that's an awful broad \nquestion and we're certainly going to have a review.  One of the \nreasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that \nsomething like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like \nthis and see what we can learn about how to handle them.  If you're \ntalking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, \nthere -- wouldn't make any change at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Two questions:  First of all, on her going on TV, \nno White House people or outside media consultants came up with this \nidea?  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the \ncampaign.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline \nafter the draft story; watching Clinton on --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's absolutely no comparison.  \nYesterday there was a law enforcement incident.  The incident ended \nin tragic deaths of many, many people.  The Attorney General was \ninvolved in that decision.  The Attorney General made the decision to \ndo that.  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of \npublic information to go out and take the questions of the press in \norder to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she \ndid a fantastic job.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The second question is, did -- as someone who knows \nClinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard \nto believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about \nwhat she intended to do?  In other words, she came and she said, I'm \ngoing to put pressure on them.  It's hard not to see Clinton, who's \nfairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What kind?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Both the Attorney General said that \nhe did ask questions, he did ask general questions.  I don't have a \nminute-by-minute account of the conversation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How long a conversation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Telephone conversation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever \na consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure --\n\t     \n\f\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe so, no.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, you keep saying that the President takes \nfull responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision.  Does \nthe President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is \nultimately his decision?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do \nwith Commander-In-Chief.  This was a law enforcement action, not a \nmilitary action.  And he clearly takes responsibility for the \ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his \ngovernment.  I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as \nhers, or is he saying it's her decision?  There's a difference.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her \ndecision.  He did not object to that decision.  He clearly takes full \nresponsibility. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, this briefing has gone on just a little \nover 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.  \nWhat exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just \nvery general?  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone \nconversation.  It was a very important phone conversation.  I think \nBrit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One of the things Reno said last night is that the \nbuck stops here.  I think that was her direct quotation.  Does the \nPresident agree with that in this case?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full \nresponsibility.  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that \nshe made a decision, that she's going to accept all the \nresponsibility that comes to her.  And she's not shrinking from that \nat all, but neither is the President. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  At any point in the conversation last night between \nthe President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever \noffer her a resignation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were \nsome Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation.  Is \nthe White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests \ntrying to make political hay out of this situation?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And I don't want to cast any \nquestions about the motives of those who are requesting \ninvestigation.  We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and \ncomplete investigation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?  \nWill you put out a written statement?  Will you -- the wires?  How \nwill you answer the question that you've taken?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you remind us what the President was \ndoing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was \ninvolved in?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.  He \nhad a series of meetings with different members of the staff during \n\f\nthe afternoon.  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and \ngetting periodic reports on that as well.  He did see some on CNN as \nwell.  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as \nwell.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And those reports would have come to him from Mack \nMcLarty, would they -- do you think?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to \nhim, I talked to him.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, to follow Helen's question, in their \nconversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last \nnight in response to the question about whether she would resign?  \nDid he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?  I'm here \nto reassure you that you don't have to do this?  Did that come up at \nall?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up \nthat specifically.  I know that the bulk of the conversation was \ndiscussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation \n--\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   The didn't talk at all about her kind of \nremarkable comment last night about --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I believe she was asked a \nquestion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And her response was, if the President wants me to, \nI will.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Which would be, I think, the \nstandard response that most Cabinet members would give.  I mean, it's \na conditional statement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     have a need to talk about whether -- personally \nabout whether the President wanted her --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they talked about \nit.  I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was \nlargely about the investigation itself.  And this just didn't come \nup.  I did not ask the question if they talked about --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will you take that with the Brit package?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, for the record, does the President want her \nto resign?  I know Dee Dee answered this morning --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  He supports Janet \nReno.  She's a good Attorney General.  She's done a good job.  She \nhandled a difficult situation extremely well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, does the President feel that he and Janet \nReno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law \nenforcement experts on the ground?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And the President is not \nsecond-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.  \nThat is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.  \nEverybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.  But the best \njudgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best \ninformation we had.\n\t     \n\f\n\t     Q\t  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on \nSunday, is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday \nmorning?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I'll take that \nquestion, too.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Were these outside experts that they were \nconsulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.  I'm just \nnot sure.  I know that there were several experts.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And also, why weren't there replacements for these \npeople?  Is the unit that small?  \n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small \nhighly-specialized unit.  But I think it's one of the kinds of things \nthat the investigation will examine.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI \nDirector?  Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, \ndoesn't only asks the Attorney General.  I know the chain of command.  \nBut presidents talk to their FBI directors.  In this case, throughout \nthis entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone \nand talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from \nhim on what to do and what not to do?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he talked to the FBI \nDirector well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke \nout in Waco.  At the same time, the Attorney General bears the \nultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the \nAttorney General.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Don't you think the ambiguous situation that \nDirector Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is \nbriefed and on the way that all of this evolved?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, it's perfectly \nappropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the \nAttorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and \nthat's following the chain of command.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you .\n\n                                 END                    1:03 P.M.

I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another\ntransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred \ntimes.

So I suppose I should just\nignore the pain, because holding my hand over the candle is something I just\nwant to do. I've got the right, don't I?\n\nYour body feels pain to let you know something is wrong.  It's your body's\nalarm system informing you that something needs your attention.\n\nA fever tells you that you are sick, and need some sort of care.\n\nGuilt can be seen as that \"emotional or spiritual\" alarm, just informing you\nthat there is something that you've done that \"requires your attention\".\n\nIt doesn't require a \"personality type\" to become a believer.  It requires\nsomeone who is willing to listen to themselves, their body & soul.  \n\n= All I know is that I don't know everything. And frankly speaking\n= I don't care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that I'm not \n= perfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy\n= and inspiring life.\n\nFor several years all I knew is I really liked dropping 'cid (LSD).\nFrankly speaking, I didn't really care.  It was fun anyway.\n\nIt didn't matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a \n*tremendously* greater risk of serious birth defects.\n\nFor several years all I knew is I really liked having sex with as many women\nas I could convice.  Frankly speaking, I didn't care.  \n\nI didn't care that I was putting each one of them at risk (as well as their\nfuture partners).\n\nIt didn't matter that for the first decade of my marriage, my wife and I\nwill have the worry that possibly that last sneeze meant something *much*\nworse than a cold.\n\n= \n= There are humans that subscribe to the same notion.

The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,\nshow the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be\ninvoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very\nconvenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to\nbe performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the\nprogram vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files\nI use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to\nuse arbitrary viewers to show special data formats.

This\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\n\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\n       examples.\n\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\n\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\n\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\nworld's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\n\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\nof the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\norganisation.\n\n\n\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\nEUTELSAT.\n\nOLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,\nwhen the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the\nend of its design life.\n\n       \n"}, {"text": "From: alaa@peewee.unx.dec.com (Alaa Zeineldine)\nSubject: Re: THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH\nOrganization: Digital Equipment Corp.\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL3\nLines: 28\n\nnstramer@supergas.dazixco.ingr.com (Naftaly Stramer) writes:\n: \n:                      THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH\n:  \n:      (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training\n: videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military\n\nAs opposed to Israel's many ways of death.

It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no\naxe to grind here. \n\n-- \nFrank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'\nodwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\n"}]}
