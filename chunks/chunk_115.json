Tangent vectors of Kochanek-Bartels splines\nOrganization: University of Trondheim\nLines: 33\n\nI'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame\npositions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I'm\nusing Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84\nproceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between\nthe key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form\n(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and\nz component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when\npositioned at (x,y,z).\n\nThe method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the\npositions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've\ntried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the\nchord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are\nnot key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the\nviewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although\nthe spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain\n- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation\nerror...)\n\nNow I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for\nsimilar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.\nI'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at\n  iharkest@lise.unit.no\nAnyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of\nthe replies if they contact me.\n\n-- \n _________     __________________\n\\\\        \\\\  \\\\\n \\\\ N G E  \\\\==\\\\ A R K E S T A D     iharkest@lise.unit.no         Comp.

Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the\ninput of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both\nchips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  \n\nIf you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an\noutboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good\nenough.

If you take off from the center and ground legs of\nthe volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably \nbefore the other controls).  \n\nIf the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should\nprobably forget the whole thing. \n\n\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055\n"}, {"text": "From: bgrubb@dante.nmsu.edu (GRUBB)\nSubject: Re: IDE vs SCSI\nOrganization: New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM\nLines: 59\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: dante.nmsu.edu\n\nwlsmith@valve.heart.rri.uwo.ca (Wayne Smith) writes:\n>>I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same\ntime, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have\nother xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude\npicture:\n\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\n |\n |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+\n |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\n |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +\n |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +\n |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\n |\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\n\nSqueezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,\nwith easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really\nneed, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.\n\nThe only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it\nis configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit\nthat file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and\ntime-consuming.\n\nTherefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }\nfunctions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click\nof a button, you can change this:\n\n    +---------+\n    + title A +\n    +------------------------+\n    +   this is the          +\n    +     body of the        +\n    +      window, window A  +\n    +------------------------+\n\nto this:\n\n                   +---------+\n                   + title A +\n    +------------------------+\n    +   this is the          +\n    +     body of the        +\n    +      window, window A  +\n    +------------------------+\n\n ===============\n\nOkay.

And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?\n\nOne way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this\nenhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a\nVery Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)\n\nIn case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing,\nlook back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of\nwindows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title;\nbut when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:\n\n        +=========+   +---------+   +=========+\n        + title B +   + title A +   + title C +\n        +-------------------------------------+\n        +   this is the body of the window,   +\n        +   window A, which is on top.        +\n        +-------------------------------------+\n\n ===================\n\nThe rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my\nX11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the\nfull diffs would be too long.\n\nThe key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the\nExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:\n\n#ifdef SHAPE\n\tcase F_SQUEEZELEFT:\n\t{\tstatic SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };\n\t\tif (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))\n\t\t  return TRUE;\n\n\t\ttmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;\n\t\tSetFrameShape( tmp_win );\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n\t.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and\n\tsqueezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ...\n#endif\n\n( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h\n  and add\n    { \"f.squeezeleft\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },\n     ... and so forth ...\nto parse.c\n\nIn order to use these functions, add something like the\nfollowing to your .twmrc file:\n\nButton2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter\n\n =================\n\nAbout a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I\n*think* it didn't get out.\n\nSince then, \"blast\" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19,\nIssue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by\nchiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a\nbelief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No,\nthe spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be\nwilling to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so \nmonologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't\nseem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree)\nthere are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been\ndoing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that\neven the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national\nboundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be\nwilling to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc)\nBut my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution\nwe have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from\nthe dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman\nor greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e.\nemperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing\nto do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human \ntorches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a \nrisen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and\ncannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection\njust cannot stand up to critical examination.\n\nrandy\n \n"}, {"text": "From: koberg@spot.Colorado.EDU (Allen Koberg)\nSubject: Packet Radio on the PC\nNntp-Posting-Host: spot.colorado.edu\nOrganization: University of Colorado, Boulder\nLines: 6\n\nI'm looking for any and all information regarding packet radio\nimplementation on the PC.

If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed\nagainst its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders\ncan be changed as well.  \n\nAs I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end\nwhen the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H are\nfinally agreed upon.

It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will\ntake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice\nC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd have\nto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they\ntake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next\n18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay\nfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen\nnot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid\nfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in\nconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly\nlegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded\nbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money going\nto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those\nwomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice\nB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see any\nreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing\npersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is\nwhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*\nis what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,\nand that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your\n\"taxes\" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being\n*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your\nobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,\nas I'm sure you would point out.

Bailey\n\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's\nreference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\n\nJ. Boswell\n\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\nsense.\n\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\n\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\nprostitute,\" since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\nfornication.\"*7\n\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\narsenokoitai \"did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \n\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\n(353).\n\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \n\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\nreason\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\n\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n4.

Yet Polycarp, who was a disiple of Hohn\nthe Apostle and died about A.D. 155, argues in the context that young men\nshould be pure.  He uses only the three terms pornoi, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nfrom Paul's list.  This at least makes Boswell's use of \"all\" subjective. \nApparently Clement of Alexandria \"Paedogogus 3.11\"; Sromata 3.18\"; also belong\nhere.\n\n10..  Yet Eusebius uses it in \"Demonstraionis evangelicae 1.\"\n11.  Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostom's use of\narsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1,\nor he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when\nChrysostom uses it.  Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our\nstudy, whether in the lists or other discussions.  Boswell later admits (351)\nthat Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on\nI Cor.  Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange, it may be that\nPaul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.  \n12.  Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here, since he renders\narsenokoitai as \"masculorum concubitores,\" corresponding \"almost exactly to the\nGreek\" (348 n.36).\n\nfootnotes:\n_______________________\n 5.

He uses only the three terms pornoi, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\nfrom Paul's list.  This at least makes Boswell's use of \"all\" subjective. \nApparently Clement of Alexandria \"Paedogogus 3.11\"; Sromata 3.18\"; also belong\nhere.\n\n 10.  Yet Eusebius uses it in \"Demonstraionis evangelicae 1.\"\n 11.  Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostom's use of\narsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1,\nor he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when\nChrysostom uses it.  Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our\nstudy, whether in the lists or other discussions.  Boswell later admits (351)\nthat Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on\nI Cor.  Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange, it may be that\nPaul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.  \n 12.  Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here, since he renders\narsenokoitai as \"masculorum concubitores,\" corresponding \"almost exactly to the\nGreek\" (348 n.36).\nNext:\nR.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\n>should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\n>-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\n\nThe story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity \nto \"know\" the two men who were Lot's guests; the fact that the Sodomites became \nangry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they \nwere interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was \nrape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some \nChristians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as \nsinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it \nwas that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended \nrape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible \nalternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those \nwho believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying \nto say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.\n\nYou seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the \nfact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to \n\"stigmatize\" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can \nsee how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion \nthat there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we're not \nsupposed to start from our conclusions because that's circular reasoning.  If \nGod is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more \nprobably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites' \nblatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I \nwill document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises \n*any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.\n\n>>\"...

And such \n>were \n>>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\n> \n>The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\n>in this.  \n\nThe moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church \nas the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be \nlegitimate, and thus the church's refusal to recognize \"perverted\" marriages \nwas circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the \nchurch ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a \nstraw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise \ndefinition/translation of \"porneia\" isn't really important, unless you are \ntrying to argue that the Bible doesn't really condemn extramarital sex.  I'm \nnot sure the moderator was trying to do that.\n\nIn any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  \nWhen Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, \"Have you not read, that He who \ncreated them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this \ncause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and \nthe two shall become one flesh'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one \nflesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.\" (Mt. \n19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife \n(female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of \nheterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, \nand not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this \nunion, in Jesus' words, because it is not something created by men.\n\nThis is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God's word.  I read in the \nBible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any \nsimilar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there \nhave been uninspired men who have ordained \"alternative\" unions (isn't Caligula \nreported to have \"married\" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to \nas \"what God has joined together\" is the heterosexual union of a man and his \nwife.\n\n(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that's probably inflammatory, and I \nshould save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  \nPlease hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of \nmy reply.)\n\nAnyway, my original question was not whether we should translate \"porneia\" in a \nway that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: \ngiven that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as \ndivinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of \nmarriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we \nneed to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You \nseem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and \nother sins) are really wrong:\n\n>>I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\n>activity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\n>\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\n>or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\n>fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\n>all \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\n>in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\n>with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\n>Christian discussion of ALL these areas.\n\nAlternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as \"porneia\" and all \nthe rest was, in Paul's day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the \n\"tutor\" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen \ncenturies drumming into the heads of God's people the idea that things like \nhomosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.  \nPerhaps Paul didn't go into detail on what \"porneia\" &c were because after 1600 \nyears he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the \nreason God's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining \na distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any \nsignificant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  \nI'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just \nwanted to point out that the New Testament's failure to develop a detailed new \nstandard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about \nsexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for \npracticing homosexuality!\n\n>Homosexual behavior is no different.

How do \nyou determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex \ndrives?  Is the desire to have \"sinful\" sex an obsessively driven mode of \nbehavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined \nas sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that \nthe person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful.  Or is it obsessive \nbecause it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that's \ncircular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even \nthough society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is \nobsessive.\n\nYou seem to be trying to limit the Bible's condemnation of \"porneia\" to only \n\"perverted\" sex acts, but I don't think you can really define \"perverted\" \nwithout falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.  What, \nthen, is Paul condemning when he declares that \"Fornicators...shall not enter \nthe kindgom of heaven\"?\n\n>I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\n>Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\n>assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.\n\nI think you misunderstood me:  I was not trying to make an argument on some \ntechnical definition of \"porneia\", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness \nof extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual \ncounterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples.\n\n>There are plenty of\n>laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\n>which Christians ignore completely.

Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual \nintercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this \nwould show that God's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual \nlaw?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual \nbehavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that \nGod's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to \njust the ritual law and those who are under the Law?\n\nI've been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the \nsubject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping \nrequirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to \nrest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on \nthe Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements \nsuch as \"Thou shalt not kill\", and requirements that are merely part of the \n(temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.\n\nThe point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of \nhomosexual intercourse as \"an abomination\" is *just* a part of the temporary, \nJews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by \nGod as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those \nguilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here's why:\n\nBack in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in \nthe possession of \"the Amorite\"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don't you think?  \nBut in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  \nit seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because \"the \niniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete\".\n\nRemember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the \niniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his \nbeing cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 \nagain.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, \nhomosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, \"Do \nnot defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the \nnations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the \nland has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so \nthe land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these \nabominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their \npeople.\"\n\nNotice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of \nMoses) are about to be punished because they have \"defiled\" themselves and \ntheir land by committing \"abominations\" that include incest, bestiality, and \nhomosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these \nsame \"abominations\" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on \nanyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man \"lying \nwith another man as one lies with a woman\" (Lv. 20:13).  Their \n\"bloodguiltiness\" was upon them, meaning that in God's eyes, they deserved to \ndie for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even \"the alien \n[non-Jew] who sojourns among you\" was to refrain from these practices, on \npenalty of being \"cut off [by God?] from among their people.\"\n\nUnder the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the \nclaim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not \nthe homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list \nsex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the \nCanaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay \nsex), I'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even \nby those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.\n\n>For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\n>be \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\n>it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\n>determine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.\n\nAccording to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable \nfor teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I \nbelieve that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can \nlearn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is \na violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law \n(for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain \nactions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I \nconclude that God's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a \nperson is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case \nof homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling \nabomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the \nLaw as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that \nGentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply \nsaying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not \nobligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to \nour exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has \ndeclared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.\n\n(continued in Part 2)\n\n- Mark\n"}, {"text": "From: cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer)\nSubject: Re: Why not concentrate on child molesters?\nOrganization: Optilink Corporation, Petaluma, CA\nLines: 27\n\nIn article <1993Apr13.104856.25246@lclark.edu>, snodgras@lclark.edu (Bil Snodgrass) writes:\n> In article <C581G8.Kw8@murdoch.acc.Virginia.EDU> gsh7w@fermi.clas.Virginia.EDU (Greg Hennessy) writes:\n> >In article <15283@optilink.COM> cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer) writes:\n# ##For a while, homosexuals paid higher insurance rates than straights,\n# ##and with very good reason, until the government made it illegal to\n# ##do so.\n# \n# Well if we go by this philosophy how many Children do you think\n# we help pay for with our insurance premiums???

Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of\nhandling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser\nMaster Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.\nIt also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower\nresolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product\nuses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent\nPC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation\nprocessed PS.\n\nThe quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for\nthe PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.\n\nWe were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was\naccepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts\nthe image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript\nprocessor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is\nresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our\ncamera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's\ndemo though).\n\nI don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be\nsurprised if there are several.\n\nGordon Lang\n\n"}, {"text": "From: cosmo@pro-angmar.alfalfa.com (Frank Benson)\nSubject: Serdar\nOrganization: UTexas Mail-to-News Gateway\nLines: 5\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu\n\nYou are quite the loser\n---\nProLine:  cosmo@pro-angmar\nInternet: cosmo@pro-angmar.alfalfa.com\nUUCP:     uunet!bu.edu!alphalpha!pro-angmar!cosmo\n"}, {"text": "From: pgeltner@netcon.smc.edu (Peter Geltner)\nSubject: Re: Soundblaster IRQ and Port settings\nOrganization: Santa Monica College, Santa Monica, CA\nLines: 23\n\nIn article <1qjv95$1t1@bogus.sura.net> vargish@bogus.sura.net (Nicholas Vargish) writes:\n>A SoundBlater (SB) card is _supposed_ to share IRQ 7 with LPT1\n>(parallel printer interface 1), and in general this scheme works well.\n>However, sometimes there are conflicts -- it seemed to depend on the\n>software more than anything else.
