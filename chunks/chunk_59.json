Science has its basis in observable fact. \n\nI'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is\ninterpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on\nthe values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\nactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or\nethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure\nfrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.\n\nBill\n\n: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\n: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\n: So, back to the original question:\n\n: And objective morality is.....?\n\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\nobjective sense.\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\ninfinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself\ndoesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\n\nBill\nmuch to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it\nor not, it's there.x\n"}, {"text": "From: jb@access.digex.com (jb)\nSubject: Re: >>> Bally's/Holiday Health Club \\\\\\ LIFETIME  MEMERSHIP ///\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications, Greenbelt, MD USA\nLines: 10\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\nIn article <C5J5K1.w0@visgraph.uucp> forrie@visgraph.uucp (Forrest Aldrich) writes:\n>\n>For sale:  Life Time membership to the Ballys'/Holiday Fitness club.

I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by\nESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was\nJewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more\nJewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, \"I'm Polish, not Jewish.\"\n\nSo maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was\na little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this\nsubject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the\nonly ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).\n\n-Alan\n"}, {"text": "From: kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi (Petri Pihko)\nSubject: Re: Atheism survey\nOrganization: University of Oulu, Finland\nLines: 88\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\n\nI replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some\nissues that are worth discussing in public.\n\nMTA (mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu) wrote:\n> I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here\n> on the net.

If you are surveying our individual\nphilosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not\njust another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,\nthe universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could\nhardly be called a philosophical system.\n\nOnce more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. \nDo not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of\nphilosophy we all agree on.\n\nSome comments on your questions:\n\n> What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)\n> your \"conversion\" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism\n> counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  \n\nI would also like to hear more about this.

You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become\natheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily\nbecome atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems\nit requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that\nreligions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.\n\nThose who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question\nquite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire\nlack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))\n\n> To what extent do you feel you \"understand\" the universe through your \n> beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything\n> from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human\n> affairs) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where\n> are they lacking as an explanatory method?  \n\nThis question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with\nthese issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.\n\nSigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet\nfor three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,\nanyway?

Larson's comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \n          space and time: \n    \n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \n    \n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \n    \n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \n          DATUM\"). \n      \n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \n          BURSTS). \n          \n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \n          matter. \n\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \n          complex mathematics, in his books. \n    \n\n\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, \"THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help \"prove\" Einstein's \"General Theory of Relativity\". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \n          holes\", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to \"prove\" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \"NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \n    \n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. \n    \n               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many \n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \n    \n               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \n          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses \n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \n    \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). \n\n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED. \n\n\n                                       Robert E.

Like Newsweek polls \nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \nsome influence over the distribution of.  \n\t     \n\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \nunpopular.  \n\t     \n\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \nour side and on the Russian side.  \n\t     \n\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \n\t     \n\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \ninvestment.  \n\t     \n\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \nof the Cold War.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \nof a very measured breakthrough.  \n\t     \n\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \ninherited from the Cold War?  \n\t     \n\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \nwe agreed to continue to press that.\n\t     \n\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \nthe NPT regime is critical.\n\t     \n\t     What was the second question?  \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \nof the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \nthem we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \nleadership of the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \nan openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \nare, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \nemigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \nis no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \nto affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \nmuch less.\n\t     \n\t     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \nmore than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \nown advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \nout of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \nbegin it in the fairly near future.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \nAnnapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \ndifferent personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \npolitical approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \nMr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \nlast part of your speech?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \nas much as I could about your history.  \n\t     \n\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \npersonal feeling about Russia.  \n\t     \n\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \noccurred.  \n\t     \n\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \ncountries become closer partners.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\n\n                               END3:06 P.M.

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted \ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\n\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3). \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \n\nReferences\n\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated. \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset. \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children's Hospital and \nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases. \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3). \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6). \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

The quacks don't do cultures.\n: They poo-poo doing more lab tests:  \"this is Lyme, believe me, I've\n: seen it many times.  The lab tests aren't accurate.  We'll treat it\n: now.\"  Also, is Dr. N's practice almost exclusively devoted to treating\n: Lyme patients?  I don't know *any* orthopedic surgeons who fit this\n: pattern.  They are usually GPs.\n\nNo, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the\ncountry, you don't need to be known as an LD \"specialist\" to see a large\nnumber of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of\nunderdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just\nabout every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,\nhe sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not\nthe only orthopedists in the town.\n\nLet's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the\n*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage\nmanifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by\nneurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem\nwe have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD\npatient.\n\nHe refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the\npatient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to\nthe knees).\n\nGordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.\n\n-Marc.\n-- \n--\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Marc C.

Center for Regional Studies\nLines: 106\n\n\n04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir\n\nBy NEJLA SAMMAKIA\n Associated Press Writer\n   \nGUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have\nbegun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner \nof the Caucasus.\n\nThe region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh,\nAbkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former\nSoviet Union to fight for independence.\n\nLezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the\nconscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared\nwar with Armenia.\n\nThey also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which\nwere effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national\nborders that had been only lines on a map.\n\nA rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and\ndemand a separate \"Lezghistan\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.\n\nOfficials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six\ndemonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures\nand began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of\nLezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.\n\nVisitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon\nafter the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.\n\nAt the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to\ndiscuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a\nwar they say is not theirs.\n\n\"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth\nglinting in the sun. \"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have\nnothing to do with Armenia.\"\n\nMore than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed\nterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.\n\nMalik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals\ndrafted in 1992 had served.\n\n\"The police don't force people to go,\" he said. \"They are afraid of an\nuprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\"\n\nAll the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but\ndisagreed on how the protest came about.\n\nSome said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was\nabout to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.\n\nOthers said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the\nLezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.\n\n\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about\ndraft orders,\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.\n\n\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, \nthe Russians.\"\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,\nin what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep\nover the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.\n\nBy 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they\ncame under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the \n600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.\n\nAbout half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.\n\n\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\" complained Mais\nTalibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,\nincluded brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.\n\n\"We want our own country,\" he said. \"We want to be able to move about easily.\nBut Baku won't listen to us.\"\n\nPhysically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other\nAzerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same \njobs and intermarrying to some degree.\n\nBut the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and\nPersian with strong guttural vowels.\n\nAzerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest\nethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary \nschool classes in their language.\n\nAutonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from\nAzerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the \nTalish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern\nAzerbaijan.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\nS.D.P.A.

M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n"}, {"text": "From: tedr@athena.cs.uga.edu (Ted Kalivoda)\nSubject: Rom 9-11 article ready..requests\nOrganization: University of Georgia, Athens\nLines: 14\n\nA section of Richard Badenas' book, \"Christ The End of the Law, Romans 10.14 \nin Pauline Perspective.\"  The section I have is on the Contextual setting and \nmeaning of Romans 9-11.

(Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\n\n  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is \nitself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around\nby the sun's ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as \"earth's\" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       /     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ /                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon's image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine's receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don't want to be a part of. \n\n  I don't claim to be the first to think these things, its just \nthat the others could have been 'pruned' from our path.
