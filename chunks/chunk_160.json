I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to\nask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a\nmarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at\nthis point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \"full page\" monitor\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\napplications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\n\nNow, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\nvia email and let me know:\n1. If you would consider buying a \"full page\" laptop screen\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\n3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea\n\nAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,\nbut who knows!), please send me some.\n\nThanks in advance!!!\n\n-Mike\n"}, {"text": "From: kene@acs.bu.edu (Kenneth Engel)\nSubject: Re: Why do people become atheists?\nOrganization: Boston University, Boston, MA, USA\nLines: 32\n\nLet me tell you my story.\nI grew up catholic.

The one most obviously\napplicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to\nspecify the \"similarity\" of matches in the data.\n\nFor example say you make up a password/phrase of \"qimwe7l\".\nOf course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not\nin any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to\nen entry that could be varied by some \"crack\" program to\nbrute-force search for it?\n\nYou use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,\none or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But \n\nagrep -3 \"qimwe7l\" bigwordandphraselist\n\nfinds that the pattern \"qimwe7l\" is too close to the\npattern \"imsel\" (part of \"himself\" and a host of others),\nto be of any cryptographic value as a key.\n\nAn error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of\nletters like \"teh\" for \"the\".  A minimally acceptable password\nwould have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately\nruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.\n(In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at\n*least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)\n\n\nAnd for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o'\ntypos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,\nsay I want to find out what people think about Gibson's\nSF book \"Neuromancer\" in the huge SF-Lover's archives.\nEven with an error distance specification as small as\nof \"1\" I will find all those people who think the title\nwas \"Necromancer\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?\n\nAlso, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL\nat Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe\nto look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or\nreligious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.\n\nYou can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000\nrandom three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that\ndon't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.\n\nYou think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing\nthe pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find\nNSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,\nNational Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.\n\nYou can also specify \"fixed\" areas: looking for license\nplate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,\nyou might say:\n\nagrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase\n\nwill find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors\n(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can\nalso \"weight\" the relative \"cost\" for substiutions, additions,\nor deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns\nfor a particular protein combination, you might know that\nsome kinds of damage cause the \"A\" nucelotide to drop out more\nthan other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting\n-Dc where you set the \"deletion cost\" to count as \"c\" errors.\n\nA steganographic use (I even used \"agrep -2 \"<steg>eograp\" E\"\njust now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally\nintroduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext\nand then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of\npossibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...\n\nAlso with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy\nto abstract the \"hits\" into a useful form.  For example,\n\nagrep -d \"^From\" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'\n\nsays output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From'\nthat contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase',\n'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.\n\nAnd agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster\nthan the second-best similarity tool publicly available.\n\nAs usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs\nto those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do\nan anonymous FTP.\n\nGet this now.\nIt is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.\n\n\nGrady Ward, vendor to the NSA (and proud of it)\n\n-- \ngrady@netcom.com  2EF221 / 15 E2 AD D3 D1 C6 F3 FC  58 AC F7 3D 4F 01 1E 2F\n\n"}, {"text": "From: jca2@cec1.wustl.edu (Joseph Charles Achkar)\nSubject: Re: the hawks WILL return to the finals!!!!!\nNntp-Posting-Host: cec1\nOrganization: Washington University, St. Louis MO\nLines: 22\n\nIn article <1qk0k4$itg@uxa.ecn.bgu.edu> cubrj@uxa.ecn.bgu.edu (Brian Johnson) writes:\n>Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little\n>easier for the playoffs.

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\n\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\n'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\nJews come and agree with them.\n\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new\nJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\n\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\n\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\n\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\nconditions were met.\n\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\nwork camps.\n\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\ndestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\nJews.\n\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\n\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\nJews.\n\nTo conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was\nconnected to another role they could, and should have played, that\nof alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They\nhad the information, but politically it was contrary to their\npriorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All\nthat furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,\nwhatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,\nare secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,\nNazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so\nbe it.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: gornish@sp1.csrd.uiuc.edu (Edward H.

Modern analogies, such as the prize for a\nhuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic\nbenefit in such a thing.

Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the\n        Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991).\n\n pages 202-203:\n\n  <<In 1865, immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the\n  Jewish community, and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning\n  to have an effect in Istanbul, local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom\n  against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa, terminus\n  of the Anatolia railroad, with three hundred Jews massacred and many more\n  beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent\n  his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [39].\n\n  In later years, ritual murder attacks against Jews, carried out mostly\n  by native Greeks, Armenians, and, in Arab provinces, by Maronites and\n  other Arab Christians, often with the assistance of the local European\n  consuls, took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands\n  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far\n  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and\n  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south\n  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These\n  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians\n  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian\n  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of\n  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian\n  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting\n  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops\n  and homes.\n\n  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of\n  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt\n  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases\n  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose\n  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the\n  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of\n  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread\n  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where\n  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes\n  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled\n  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with\n  little question or opposition.\n\n  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British\n  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David\n  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:\n\n    ''Sir,\n\n      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which\n      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which\n      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,\n      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.\n      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,\n      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison\n      the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article,\n      he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover, of course\n      this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40]\n\n  Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent\n  Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence\n  or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then\n  failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated\n  or led them. [41]\n\n  The leader of the Ashkenazi community of Corlu complained to the\n  president of AIU [Alliance Israelite Universelle] in 1902 about\n  persistent Greek attacks against its Jewish quarter:\n\n    ''The fanatic Greeks of our city, as of other places in Thrace,\n    have the habit of, contrary to the spirit of real Christianity,\n    making a replica of Judas Iscariote and of burning it on the night\n    of Holy Saturday. They construct a wooden figure, cover it with\n    clothing which they claim is that of the ancient Jews, and they\n    burn it publicly in the middle of a multitude of the ignorant and\n    the fanatic. It often happens that this multitude, already excited\n    by the tales of the suffering of Christ that has been made to them\n    at the Church, is exaulted at the appearance of the execution of he\n    who is supposed to have betrayed Christ, and works up a great anger\n    against the Jews...For a long time we have known that each year,\n    on such a day, they will cut off the heads and arms of the corpses\n    in our cemetery and will burn them with great solemnity. We make\n    no complaint about this in order not to create differences between\n    the two communities. But this audacious madness of these fanatics\n    has increased. We ourselves see the flames and hear the cries of\n    hatred and vengeance against the Jews.''[42]>>\n\n\n[39] El Tiempo, 28 April 1926; Galante, Istanbul I, 185; Galante, Documents V,\n     340-41.\n\n[40] FO 78/430, enclosed in Baring no.207 to Lord Salisbury, Cairo,\n     25 June 1890, reprinted in Landau, 'Ritual Murder Accusations', p.450.\n\n[41] Jacob Landau, 'Ritual Murder Accusations and Persecutions of Jews\n     in Nineteenth Century Egypt', Sefunot V (1961), 425-427; for example\n     see report in BAIU [Bulletin de l'Alliance Israelite Universelle:\n     Deuxieme Serie (Paris)], first semestre 1881, pp.66-67.

There is no question that\norally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all\nneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median\neminence. These areas are responsible for the production of\nhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal\ndevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \n\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to\n\"sacrifice\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\nindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine\nand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be\nuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on\npsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and\nphysiology.\n\nI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities\n(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its\nimplication for adults (me).  Certainly\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\nendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*\nattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. \n\n>>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you\n>>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles\n>>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever. \n>\n>You mean \"asserting\".

It says nothing about the frequent\n>inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.\n\nOlney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some\nsensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally\nadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone\nfluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant\nsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient\nrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is\nresponsible not only for control of growth during development, but\nalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of\nheadaches?

Nor\n#> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n#> is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as\n#> if there were no Benefactor/Bug (two statements, both would be false).\n#\n#This is still contradictory. It reduces to\n#\n#  (1): Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to [benefactor or bug].\n#\n#  (2): this is not evidence for [benefactor], neither is it evidence for\n#       [bug] (meaning that it doesn't lend more weight to one than to the\n#       other)\n#\n#  (3): therefore no evidence can exist for [benefactor] and no evidence\n#       can exist for [bug].\n#\n#But (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2). When you say (paraphrased)\n#in (2) that this is not \"evidence for [benefactor]\", for example, what you\n#mean is that it's no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].\n\nYes, that's what I mean.\n\n#In (3), however, you've shifted the meaning of \"evidence for [benefactor]\"\n#so that it now means `absolute' \"evidence for [benefactor]\" rather than\n#`relative' \"evidence for [benefactor]\" w.r.t. [bug].\n\nNot really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I\nthink this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,\nin my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates\nto theism making predictions (prayer, your 'Rapture' example), I don't\nbuy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A=0.\n\nIn my example, one couldn't dismiss\n[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary\nto explain the dosh.  I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal' process to\nshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you're saying in this\npost, it seems you agree, and we're talking at cross-purposes.\n\n#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).\n#\n#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:\n#\n#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1\n#\n#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it's either the benefactor *or* a bug\n#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then\n#\n#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)\n#\n#so\n#\n#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1\n#\n#but (3) implies that\n#\n#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.\n\nNo, this isn't what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\nnecessarily no new observation (we've already seen the dosh) to change\nthose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that\nit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that's\nprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are\none class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of\nhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise \nwould _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or\nretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   \nAlternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds\nthat the answer can't be known, or that the notional probability estimates\nare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).\n\n#> As they do when the set M is filled by \"the universe is caused by x\",\n#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation\n#> tends to one conclusion over the other.\n#\n#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don't \"throw out\" any of\n#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.\n\nSome people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.\nMy sole point was that they aren't.\n\n#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x\n#>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite\n#>> number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the\n#>> hypotheses out.\n#\n#> Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear.\n#\n#You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.\n\nI was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.\n\n#> What I'm trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of\n#> evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence, this does not hold true for\n#> all, or perhaps any, versions of theism - and it isn't true that those for\n#> which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor.\n#\n#On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which\n#can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this\n#thread.\n\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which\nmeans that you're assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we've already\nestablished that it's not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over\nall i.\n\n#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or\n#> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and\n#> at worst barking mad.\n#\n#Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous\n#occasions. You wouldn't be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?\n#Although that doesn't, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case\n#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).\n#\n#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is\n#\"evidence against\" an hypothesis, that doesn't imply that observation of\n#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the\n#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it's still\n#evidence against H.\n\nNo, I got that.  I'm talking about the case when A=0.  You're clearly\ncorrect when A!=0.   And I'm not constructing a strawman (though it's\ncertainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying).  However,\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist, or are unnecessary\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\na fallacy upon close examination.

I told them that a local 1.9 rating was\nnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time\nwithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon\nis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.\nShe told me that they had contractual obligations.

If you really want Tom to reply\nyou should send mail to support@qdeck.com.\n\nA 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps\nethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on \nwhat you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances\nof some really nasty program like \"Smoking Clover\" would make the link \nuseless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly\nupdating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real\nworld, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.\n\nGoing by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have\nto share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.\n\n>>Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\n>>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\n>>thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\n>>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\n>\n>Hmmm.

The usage patterns are not very\ngood predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth\nlinks that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they\noften use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database \nremotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always\nat this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview\nX and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having\na long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about\nhow you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.\n\nRunning Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.\nLet's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy\nand efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a\nlittle more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen\nthat was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server\nthat it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough\nmemory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network\ntraffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a \nsolid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite\neasily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send\nit back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw\nthat small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be \nrepainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits\nthat has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.\nIn reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts \nthat will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.\n\n>\n>\n>>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\n>>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\n>>doing network things also...)\n>>-- \n>\n>What do you mean by network things?

I am wondering how \n>good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these \n>images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.\n\nX was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's \npretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost\nas good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.\nWe intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver\nkeyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in\nno way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a \nlot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but\nwe are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications\ntell us.\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   |\n|         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\\  |\n|  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\\  |\n|   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\\  |\n|          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\\  |\n|    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\\  |\n|     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\\  |\n|         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n"}, {"text": "From: shah@pitt.edu (Ravindra S Shah)\nSubject: Re: ABC coverage\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 28\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\nJoseph B Stiehm (joe13+@pitt.edu) wrote:\n\n\n: I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show\n: the shots, not the hits.
