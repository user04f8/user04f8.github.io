I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme\nis to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,\neither using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme\nlike Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared\nsession key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone\ncompany or some other online central authority generates a session key and\nsends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of\nhaving some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for\na copy of the session key for each call.\n \n   Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of\nevery public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will\nbe some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally-\nsigned (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,\nstored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to\neveryone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the\nsecurity of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your\ndesignated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.\n \n   It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to\nuse either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair\nand verification scheme.

Overacker) writes:\n\n   You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\n   stood by the Pope.\n\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\ndisobeyed.\n\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\n\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\n   authority and discipline.  \n\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\nbishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.\n\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\nhour, probably.\n\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\n\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\n\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\n\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\n\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\n\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n\t the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n\t don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\n   If I adopt the view that \"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\n   there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\n   I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an\ninstant non-Catholic.\n\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\ndoing, they would be shocked!\n\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n\nThis isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\ndoctrine is.\n\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\n   I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nThat's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\nspread that it's pitiful.\n\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\nfact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\nrun.\n\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\n   Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.\n   Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,\n   one way or the other.\n\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\n\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\n   Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\n\nNot really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last\n300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels at\ncritical thought, remember?  That's what Catholic theologians have\nbeen busy at for centuries.\n"}, {"text": "From: max@slinky.NYU.EDU (David Max)\nSubject: 24bit mode on Speedstar 24X\nSummary: Routines for 24 bit color on Speedstar 24X?\nKeywords: Diamond Speedstar 24X 24bit 16.7\nOrganization: New York University\nLines: 12\n\n\n   I have a Diamond Speedstar 24X board that I want to program\nfor 24 bit 640x480 graphics, or possibly 800x600 16 bit color.\nDoes anybody have any libraries supporting these modes on this\nboard?

Since\nX    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works\nX    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add\nX    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.\nX    (see \"The New Hacker's Dictionary\" by Eric Raymond)\nX\nX    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before\nX    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email\nX    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may\nX    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\nX\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\nX    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines\nX    prior to submitting entries.

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\n\n\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\n\n\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \ntheir source distributions of X11.\n\n\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\n\t\tsend fixes #\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\n\n\tHere are a few complications:\n\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \n\"5d\" separately\n\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]\n\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\n\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\n\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\n\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \npreviously was optional\n\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\n\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\n\n\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \nit a request, and it mails back the response.\n\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \nof the message.\n\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\n\n\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \nmore detailed version of this help file.\n\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \nrequests an index cannot request data.\n\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\n\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \nday's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out \nshortest-first.\n\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If \nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\nor\n        path bar!foo!frotz\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\n\n\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\n\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  60)!

Where can I get an X-based paint/draw program?\n\n\txpic is an object-oriented drawing program. It supports multiple font \nstyles and sizes and variable line widths; there are no rotations or zooms.\nxpic is quite suitable as an interactive front-end to pic, though the \nxpic-format produced can be converted into PostScript. (The latest version is \non the R4 contrib tape in clients/xpic.)\n\n\txfig (by Brian V. Smith (bvsmith@lbl.gov)) is an object-oriented \ndrawing program supporting compound objects.  The xfig format can be converted \nto PostScript or other formats. Recent versions are on the R5 contrib tape or \non export in /contrib/R5fixes (version 2.1.6 [11/92]).\n\n        idraw supports numerous fonts and various line styles and arbitrary \nrotations. It supports zoom and scroll and color draws and fills. The file \nformat is a PostScript dialect. It can import TIFF files. Distributed as a part\nof the InterViews C++ toolkit (current release 3.1, from \ninterviews.stanford.edu) .\n\n\tA version of Robert Forsman's (thoth@lightning.cis.ufl.edu) xscribble,\nan 8-bit paint program for X, is now on ftp.cis.ufl.edu in pub/thoth/.

(It may require OpenWindows and Sun C++ 2.0.)\n\n\ttgif by William Cheng (william@oahu.cs.ucla.edu) is available from most\nuucp sites and also from export and from cs.ucla.edu. It is frequently updated;\nversion 2.12-patch18 was released 3/93.\n\n\tThe \"pixmap\" program (info: colas@sa.inria.fr) for creating pixmaps is \non the R5 contrib tape; it resembles the bitmap client. Version 2.1 is now \navailable. [11/92]\n\n\tAlthough MetaCard is not generally classified as a paint program, a \nfull 24-bit color image editor is built into the program, which can be used for\nlight image editing and for producing color icons (info@metacard.com).

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald\n was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy\n to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed\n on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest\n periods I've seen Sweden play this year.\n Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many\n times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial\n save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal\n from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way\n to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a\n nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4\n just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of\n the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. \n Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled\n through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,\n Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close\n range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,\n and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.\n\n Switzerland:\n\n Goaltender:  20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio)\n Defense:     26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger\n              16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch\n               7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter\n              31 Samuel Balmer\n Forwards:    22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger\n              23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald\n              35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle\n              15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio\n \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0)\n\n 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4:28\n      CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12:20 (pp)\n 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9:40\n      RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16:24\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic\n Attendance: 8,600\n\n Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't\n enough to win against the effective Canadians.\n\n Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just\n deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play\n goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the\n far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.\n Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of\n the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.\n Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya\n entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,\n then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to\n deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.\n The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side\n and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.\n \n Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri\n Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and\n in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,\n and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros\n after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.\n\n Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,\n 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player\n (among those Kariya with 1+6).

The supplied screw to set the \nbackrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, \nhard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a\na soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.\n\nThe driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable\nenough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat\nwithout a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the \nvolume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it\nseems much more comfortable.

My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable\n: for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors\n: on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, \n: the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable\n: with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But\n: for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug\n: in the cable to align these.  \n\nMost IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed\ncircuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your\nIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in\nthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle\nis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide\npositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:\nlook into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On\nall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin\nis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard\nfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins\n39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep\nthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the\ncable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the\npin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But\nbeware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables\nwith pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors\nthis doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide\nwhich side is pin 1.\n\n: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\n: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\n: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the \"master\" drive\n: and which into the \"Slave\"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...\n\nIt doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives\nare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you\nshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the\ndrive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper\nselects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the \ndocuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,\nthen just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have\none.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like\nyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't\nhave convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice\nhelp.  Or post the specific question to this group.

Detweiler)\nSubject: An Open Letter to Mr. Clinton\nNntp-Posting-Host: dolores.lance.colostate.edu\nOrganization: Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO  80523\nLines: 123\n\n\nI'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal \nassault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration \nnor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever \nin regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating \n`acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we \nshould rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious \nproposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration\nreceive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.\n\nI am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology\nto restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S.\ngovernment will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any\nserious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone\nwith an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this \nproposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they\nare merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the\npublic, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is \nwholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.\n\n>While encryption\n>technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\n>unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\n>by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nIt seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be \ntappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to\nthe U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions\nof dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.\nThese actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope\nMr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.\nBut if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should\nfind merit with it nevertheless.)\n\nCryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong \ncryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, \nhousewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable \nequilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian \narrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and\nguaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent \nimpracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.\n\n>For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\n>private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\n>tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\n>protecting Americans.\n\nFor too long our government has demonstrated itself to be \nincreasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality \nand protecting Americans.\n\n>Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\n>role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\n>quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\n>its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\n>protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\n>them from those who break the law.\n\nIt is not possible for the Federal Government\nto ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive\npolicies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such\na thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to\ndeprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.\n\nThe administration has to be committed to leaving private \nindustries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no \nlegitimate role in regulating the content of communications.\nLaw enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their\nsurveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be \ndisarmed of it. \n\n>Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n>     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n>     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n>     powerful encryption devices?\n\nNo such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent\nto a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of \nextortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism.

Deputy\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\n\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\n\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\n\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\nStriker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\n\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\n\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\n\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\nand fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\nBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\n\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\"  Nevin also\npointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\ndecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\nhim [no answer was available].\n\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\n\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\n\nDrew\n==============================================================\n\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************\n"}, {"text": "From: eczcaw@mips.nott.ac.uk (A.Wainwright)\nSubject: Re: New Study Out On Gay Percentage\nReply-To: eczcaw@mips.nott.ac.uk (A.Wainwright)\nOrganization: Nottingham University\nLines: 25\n\nIn article <15437@optilink.COM>, cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer) writes:\n\n\n\n|> You might -- except that gay men are MUCH more promiscuous than\n|> straight men -- which shows how damaged and screwed up gay men are.\n|> \n\nExcuse me a moment when I laugh my head off...

If someone were to seize\na safe containing your (paper) records, and demand that you produce\nthe combination, the applicable defense would be on grounds of\nunreasonable search and seizure.  The police would be entitled to\nsubpoena documents relating to a specific matter, but any broad search\nsuch as implied by impounding all your records would be unconstitutional.\nIn the case of the safe, they would probably get a locksmith and\nassert that they ONLY examined documents covered by the warrent.\n(Sure!)  In the cryptographic case, their only resort would be\nrubber-hose cryptography.\n\n    (This would also make a good \"mental experiment\" to use in\nchoosing escrow agents.

It's compatible with the\n    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,\n    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.\n    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.\n    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the\n    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.\n    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as\n    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.\n    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,\n    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.\n    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:\n\tSunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0\n\tSolaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0\n\tSolaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1\n\n    See Also:\n\tMixing X11 and OpenWindows\n\tWhere can I get it?\n\n@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?\n    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs\n    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography\n    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:\n\n    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;\n    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were\n    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,\n    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the\n    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in\n    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in\n    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a\n    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).\n    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably\n    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or\n    anything else that uses subclasses.\n    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]\n\n    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in\n    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help\n    migrate source code from SunView to XView.\t XView is often said to be\n    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.\n    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is\n    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).\n    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.\n    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the\n    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be\n    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.\n    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much\n    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.\n\n    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based\n    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the\n    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of\n    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.\n\n    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some\n    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to\n    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time\n    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.\n    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the\n    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.\n    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.\n\n    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++\n    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from\n    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify\n    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be\n    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the\n    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.\n    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of\n    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in\n    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).\n\n@ Where does Motif fit in?\n    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that\n    is being developed by OSF.\tIt has a `look and feel' reminiscent of\n    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-\n    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold\n    reasonably cheaply by OSF.\tAlthough Motif is currently available on\n    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly\n    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a\n    large installed base.\n    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif\n    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in\n    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.\n\n@ What is MoOLIT?\n    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between\n    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V\n    Release 4.2.\n    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677\n\n@ What about that Display PostScript thing?\n    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X\n    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed\n    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a\n    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously\n    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it\n    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less\n    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.\n    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;\n    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.\n    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS\n    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to\n    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.\n    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts\n    available, however)\n\nSubject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm\n\n@ What are olwm and olvwm?\n    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window\n    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows\n    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.\n\n    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.\n    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and\n    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.\n\n    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the\n    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the\n    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.\t You can\n    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This\n    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around\n    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm\n    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.\n    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib\n    directory; there are three patches).\n\n@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?\n    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use\n    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the\n    footers some windows use to display certain messages.\n\n    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus\n    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run\n    under olwm.\n    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:\n\tLeftTitleButton \"target\" = f.delete\n    where \"target\" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.\n    Alternatively, try\n\t# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm\n\tLeftTitleButton \":menu\" = f.menu \"OL.menu\"\n\n\tmenu \"OL.menu\" {\n\t    \"Quit\"         f.delete\n\t}\n\n    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title\n    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).\n\n    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).\n\nSubject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays\n\n@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?\n    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.\n    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.\n    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS\n    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes\n    pageview in particular.\n\n    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-\n    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)\n    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about\n    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.\n    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you\n    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's\n    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.\n\n\nSubject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows\n     \n@ What configuration files do I need to know about?\n\n    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc\n\n    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in\n    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to\n    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files\n    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.\n\n    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,\n    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.\n\n    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys\n\n    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,\n    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.\n    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files\n    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need\n    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an\n    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,\n    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's \"contool\" program so that\n    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.\n    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.\n\n    .Xdefaults\n\n    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,\n    it is a good idea to include at least:\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:\ttrue\n\t*Input: TRUE\n    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they\n    forget to ask for it.\n\n    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default\n    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.\n    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.\n\n    .startup.ps\n\n    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)\n    on startup.\t This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the\n    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change\n    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a\n    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up\n    at all or will get broken in strange ways.\tThe NeWS manual gives code\n    that is both incorrect and insufficient.\n    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.\n\n    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see\n    the man page for xset (\"man xset\", and \"xset -help\") for more information.\n\n    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of\n    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of\n    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for\n    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime\n    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to\n    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your\n    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...\n\n\t% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual\n\t% /IncludeDemos? false def\n\n\tUserProfile begin\n\t    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def\n\t    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def\n\t    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...\n\tend\n\n    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:\n\n\t/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\t/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\t/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\n\n\tClassRepeatKeys pop\t% force repeat.ps to autoload\n\n\tendpackage endpackage endpackage\n\n    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the\n    OpenWindows server like this:\n\t$ psh -i .startup.ps\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n\t$ psh -i\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\n\t/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send\n\t%%% now press control-D\n\n    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make\n    the root window be \"retained\", so that a PostScript drawing on the\n    background won't be erased when you move windows:\n\tframbuffer /Retained true put\n    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used\n    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.\n    \n    See also:\n\tTrouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type\n\tTrouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults?\n\tEnvironment Variables\n\n@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?\n    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one\n    or two occasional surprises.  See also \"man 7 xview\" for a list of\n    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.\n\n    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings\n    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should\n    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this\n    in your .xinitrc:\n\n    if eval `svenv -env`\n    then\n\txmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3\"\n\tinput_from_defaults\n    else\n\txmodmap -e \"pointer = 3 2 1\"\n    fi\n\n\n@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?\n\n    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but\n    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.\n    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as\n    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system\n    run screenblank automatically.\n\nSubject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste\n\n@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?\n\n    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):\n    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button\n      in xterm\n    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly\n      XView manual gets this wrong)\n    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)\n\n    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste\n\n   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:\n    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY\n    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).\n    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.\n\n@ COPY/PASTE is boring.\t What short-cuts are available?\n\n    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:\n    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button\n    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined\n      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)\n    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.\n    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection\n    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-\n      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button\n    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection\n    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse\n      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the\n      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).\n    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want\n      to drop the text\n    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show\n      that it's OK to drop things here\n    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.\tThis works in text fields of\n      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.\n\n    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection\n    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that\n      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.\n\n@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?\n\n    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.\n    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when\n    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the\n    right of the insert point.\n\n\tMeta-i - include file\t    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)\n\n\tCtrl-a - start of line\t    Ctrl-< - back word\n\tCtrl-e - end of line\t    Ctrl-> - forward word\n\tCtrl-w - delete word\t    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line\n\tCtrl-Return - move to end/START of document\n\n    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default\n    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.\n\n@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?\t Where is it documented?\n\n    See the manual page for shelltool.\n\nSubject: Applications: Finding Out...\n    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,\n    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_\n    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.\n\n    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular\n    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor\n    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full\n    product documentation.\n\n    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which\n    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as\n    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.\n\n    There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists\n    a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a\n    copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a\n    faster reply.\n\nSubject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.\n\n@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?\n    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.\n    If \"man cm_delete\" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under\n    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.\n\n@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?\n    The best way is:\n    $ cd\n    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .\n    $ chmod +w .textswrc\n    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)\n    add the follwing:\n\tKEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER\n\tcat ~/.signature\n    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)\n\n    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.\n\n\n\nSubject: Fonts\n\n@ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?\n    Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).\n    Or, Not Yet, in other words.\n\n    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.\n    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and\n    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is\n    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the\n    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on\n    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.\n\n    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably\n    other major foundries.\n\n    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.\n\n@ Improving font rendering time\n    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as\n    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes\n    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache\n    parameters.\t If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the\n    font cache size.\n\t$ psh -i\n\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you\n\tcurrentfontmem =\t% type this line ...\n\t300\t% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes\n\t1024 setfontmem\n\t% Just to check:\n\tcurrentfontmem =\n\t1024\n    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.

If you're\n    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of\n    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.\n\n@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?\n    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.\n    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output\n    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.\n    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.

These notes apply to\n    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with\n    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.\n\n    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.\tYou can intermix OpenWindows\n    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.\n    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.\n\n    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions\n    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a\n    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory\n    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have\n    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in\n    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead\n    of OpenWindows ones!\n\n    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11\n    library directory.\tThis doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with\n    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't\n    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although\n    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.\n\n    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't\n    /usr/openwin.\n\n    See Also:\n\tEnvironment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).\n\n@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found\n    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use\n\t     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib\n    If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use\n    ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for\n    /bin/sh; for csh it is different.\n\n@ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero\n    Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches\n    and install the patch.\n\n@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?\n    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.\tIt won't run under\n    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw\n    the PostScript text and pictures.\n    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0\n    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.\n    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace\n    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to\n    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)\n    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.\n    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with\n    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).\n\n@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?\n    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from\n    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z\n\n@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?\n    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties\n    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.\n\n@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool\n    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also\n    works if you run command tool on a remote machine.\n    Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.\n\n@ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!\n    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be\n    selected via the keyboard.

Smith\ncame out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the\nback of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what\nhappened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never\nhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan\nof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. \n\nIt was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie\nat the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting\nin pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of \ntheir own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the \ngoaltender, or whatever.\n\nAnd to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only\nsay that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.\nThere was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late\nin the third period of the 7th game of the second round.
