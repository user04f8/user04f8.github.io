I'd\n> \tlove to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such\n> \tlow volume :-)\n\nMost commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage;\nthat's handled by the big caps on the primary side, those which in a \nlinearly-regulated power supply would be considered the \"filter\" caps,\ncoming right after the bridge.  The transformer is just that - a \ntransformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although\nthe inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT\nnegligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to\nget one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a\n\"snubber\" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended\nfor switcher use today have the diode built in.)\n\nThe basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in\na somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a\nhigh voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or\n\"filter\") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.\nThe transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,\nresulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which \nare then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs\nis sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,\nwhich acts in a \"pulse-width modulation\" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying\nthe pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and\ntherefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs\nmay be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less\ntracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear\nregulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the \nregulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)\nis not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various\nsafety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be\nelectrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator\nto meet this requirement.\n\nWhile the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these\ndesigns, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can\nbe ignored; besides the inductive \"kick\" giving the switch transistor a\nbad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the\nenergy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.\nIn some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,\nyou need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't\nsaturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the \nimagination! :-)).\n\nI'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; \nhopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors\nin the above.\n\n\nBob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not\n                   Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any other\nmyers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.\n"}, {"text": "From: al885@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Gerard Pinzone)\nSubject: Mitsumi CD ROM drivers fix for QEMM\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH (USA)\nLines: 14\nReply-To: al885@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Gerard Pinzone)\nNNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu\n\n\nJust to let all you faithful Mitsumi CD Rom owners....\n\nEver notice QEMM can't load you CD Rom driver high?

As far as\n  I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement\n  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel\n  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:\n\n  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform\n     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female\n     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but\n     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\n     provocation is required.\n\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\n\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\n       as document checks.\n\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\n       armed response.\n\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\n       if necessary.\n\n--- D.

An\n>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival\n>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. \n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\n\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\n>Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.

They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than\n>they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.\n\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \n\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\nmake people around them better.\n\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\n\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\n\n>This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't\n\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>\n\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\n>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.\n>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because\n>they are winning.\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.\n\nI did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \nCFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If \nthat's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious\nto hear your explanation.\n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: oueichek@imag.fr (Ibaa Oueichek)\nSubject: Help identifying this card\nNntp-Posting-Host: gram2\nOrganization: IMAG Institute, University of Grenoble, France\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL5\nLines: 23\n\n\tI have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC.

(Around 5 MB.)\n\nI have a Quadra 950. \nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\n         (using block-mode transfers)\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\n\nLet's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\n\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\n\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \n\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\n        ...\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\n\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n--David\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| David Blume            | \"I get tired thinking of all the things I  |\n| dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don't want to do.\"  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n"}, {"text": "From: grady@netcom.com (1016/2EF221)\nSubject: Re: MacPGP 2.2 Source Problems\nOrganization: capriccioso\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nLines: 19\n\nYes -- my error -- you will need the DIFF between the\nstandard console.h and console.c supplied with\nSymantec's THINK C 5.0.4 and the specially modified\none that works with MacPGP 2.2.\n\nI added the two DIFFs to the end of the signature\nfile \"MacPGP2.2srcSIGNATURE\" in pub/grady of netcom.com\n\nPlease download via anonymous FTP and, using SED (oops),\ncutting and pasting, fix-em-up.        \n\nWill one of you Mac-geniuses PLEASE port this to MacApp\nor AppMaker, or...?\n\nGrady\n\n-- \ngrady@netcom.com  2EF221 / 15 E2 AD D3 D1 C6 F3 FC  58 AC F7 3D 4F 01 1E 2F\n\n"}, {"text": "From: savastan@savy.East.Sun.COM (Paul Savastano - Sun USOPS CSU Supply Unit Master Scheduling)\nSubject: No No Box\nOrganization: Sun Microsystems, Inc.\nLines: 39\nDistribution: world\nReply-To: savastan@savy.East.Sun.COM\nNNTP-Posting-Host: savy.east.sun.com\n\n\n\nBOSTON (0) AT SEATTLE (7)\n \n BOSTON          AB  R  H BI  SEATTLE         AB  R  H BI\n RILES 2B         3  0  0  0  FELDER LF        4  0  1  1\n QUINTANA RF      2  0  0  0  COTTO DH         3  0  0  0\n GREENWELL LF     3  0  0  0  SASSER PH        1  0  0  0\n DAWSON DH        3  0  0  0  GRIFFEY JR CF    4  0  0  0\n M VAUGHN 1B      3  0  0  0  BUHNER RF        3  1  0  0\n CALDERON CF      3  0  0  0  BOONE 2B         4  2  3  2\n COOPER 3B        3  0  0  0  T MARTINEZ 1B    3  1  1  0\n JOHN VALENTIN SS 3  0  0  0  BLOWERS 3B       4  1  2  1\n PENA C           3  0  0  0  VALLE C          4  1  2  2\n                              VIZQUEL SS       4  1  2  0\n TOTALS          26  0  0  0  TOTALS          34  7 11  6\n \n BOSTON                  000 000 000-- 0\n SEATTLE                 022 102 00x-- 7\n E--GREENWELL.

A genocide of Armenians took place\nduring peacetime.\n\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\n\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \ndidn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\nwouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd \nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know \nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\n\nSuddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\n\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What's going on? What's \nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don't open the door, we \nsay, \"If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they've \nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \naxe, and then with a crowbar.\n\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\nwere many of them.\n\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What's with you, \nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \ndon't need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't \nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \nevening and all through the night.\n\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\nin the room.\n\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\nwe say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \none o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back \nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \nwent up to the neighbor's.\n\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\n19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \nweren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They're up there, still,\nup there. Let's go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that's from some of the \nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \nhim down.\n\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and \nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\n\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the \napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At\nfirst the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\n\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \nsaved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely \naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\nable to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \ntroops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \ngenocide.\n\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '\npick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock \nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It \nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \nman there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces \nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\n\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \nfather, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.\n\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\n\nI'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \nweren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \nweren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \nat the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \ncame to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\n\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\n\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\n\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\npossible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could \nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\nout for such deeds.\n\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took \npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\n\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\n\n   May 18, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Such a class would normally cost $40\nor $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.\n\nOur Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished\nteaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been\nvery well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices\ninterested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but\nfeel they should know something about \"gun safety\" since members\nof their family keep guns at home.\n\nTeaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:\n\n(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases\n    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.\n\n(2) A \"gun safety\" class is Politically Correct, and likely to\n    be viewed positively by the public and the media.\n\n(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)\n    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a\n    gentle introduction to firearms.\n\n(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun\n    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.\n\n(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners\n    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,\n    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate\n    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun\n    students sometimes tell us they have \"something new to think\n    about\" with regards to personal gun ownership.\n\n(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.\n\nOur course is the standard NRA-certified \"Home Firearm Safety\"\nclass, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also\nteach the NRA's \"Personal Protection\" class, although the cost\nis higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.\n\nI think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to\ngun buy-backs.\n\n                               -- Alane --\n   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\n  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    \"I am a jelly doughnut\"      \\\n /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\\n/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n"}, {"text": "From: klute@tommy.informatik.uni-dortmund.de (Rainer Klute)\nSubject: Re: Imake-TeX: looking for beta testers\nOrganization: CS Department, Dortmund University, Germany\nLines: 59\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: tommy.informatik.uni-dortmund.de\n\nIn article <1rl3efINNl7p@fbi-news.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE>,\nklute@tommy.informatik.uni-dortmund.de (Rainer Klute) writes:\n|> As I announced at the X Technical Conference in January, I would like\n|> to\n|> make Imake-TeX, the Imake support for using the TeX typesetting system,\n|> publically available.

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \nwhen performing diagnostics.\n   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way \ninterface connector. They have the following functions and are described \nin order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper \ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector.\n\nLK2: LED \n     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the\n     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\n     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will\n     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130\n     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.\n\nLK1: Dual Drives\n     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\n     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,\n     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.\n\nLK4: Master\n     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\n     jumpered in this way.\n\nLK5: IOChRdy\n     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is \n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\n     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per\n     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally \n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per\n     second.\n\n   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)\nmay be jumpered:\n\n     Master, single drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 & LK4 fitted.\n     Master, single drive without LED on interface\tLK4 only fitted.\n     Master, dual drive without LED on interface\tLK4 & LK1 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface\t\tNo jumpers fitted.\n     Master, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 only fitted.\n\n   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.\n\n   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way \nconnector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected\nby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the \ndrive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further\ndetails.\n\n\n\n\n***************************   S E A G A T E   *************************\n\nThere is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on\nevery Simtel mirror under\n\n/msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip\n\nIt contains info about the following drives:\n\n\t    st1144a\tst138a\t    st274a\tst3283a\nst1057a     st1156a\tst1400a     st280a\tst351ax\nst1090a     st1162a\tst1401a     st3051a\tst9051a\nst1102a     st1186a\tst1480a     st3096a\tst9077a\nst1111a     st1201a\tst157a\t    st3120a\tst9096a\nst1126a     st1239a\tst2274a     st3144a\tst9144a\nst1133a     st125a\tst2383a     st325ax\n\n\n*********************\tT E A C   **************\n\nModel: SD-3105\n\n                Cyls.
