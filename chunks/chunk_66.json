My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the\npossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in\n1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book\nbecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written\nfrom a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept\nan open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the \"yeast\nconnection\".\n\nBut, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right\nclinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In\nthe meantime, I'd still encourage people who have \"incurable\" chronic sinus\nproblems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to\nadminister a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with\nliver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It\nis an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT\nsays \"sorry, you'll just have to live with it\", it is time to step out and\ntry an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence\n(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At\nthis stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and\nhave the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive\nclinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with\nrelatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since I\nsaw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of\ncourse, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not\nwork for you.

King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\n\n * \"The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\n *  treated as a matter of faith.\" -- Francis Hitching                     *\n\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\n\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\n\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\n    not be your real intent.\n\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\n\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\n\n\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\n\n * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\n\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster's B^).  Francis Hitchings\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\n\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\ntitled \"`Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far\".  Excerpts include :\n\n  \"Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.\"  \"He goes after Darwin like Mark\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.\"  \"He suggests\n  a mystical `organizing principle' of life, using the similarity of organs\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic].\"\n\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\nagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't\nsurprise me much.  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.\nhe only posted a quote).\n\n\n  UUCP:  uunet!tektronix!sail!mikec  or                  M.Cranford\n         uunet!tektronix!sail.labs.tek.com!mikec         Principal Troll\n  ARPA:  mikec%sail.LABS.TEK.COM@RELAY.CS.NET            Resident Skeptic\n  CSNet: mikec@sail.LABS.TEK.COM                         TekLabs, Tektronix\n\n"}, {"text": "From: glang@slee01.srl.ford.com (Gordon Lang)\nSubject: Re: HELP!

Questions to Israelis\n\n\nTo:  shaig@Think.COM\n\nSubject: Ten questions to Israelis\n\nDear Shai,\n\nYour answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of\nIsraeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have\nreceived from other quarters, according to which there are two\ndistinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship\n(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports\netc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\nam told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\ntimes and present them at many public places, almost every day.\nThese ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\nYou maintain that this mainly because of religious services\nprovided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\nCould you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\nserves no other purpose ?\n\nIn the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\nIsrael has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were\n'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I\nread, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\nplans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\nTransjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\nBen-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was\nestablished, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for\nlater expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\nfact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\nland to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\npromised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\nborders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\ntoday ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what\nit considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\nbase for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\ncannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\nnumber of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\n\nYour answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\nofficial. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\nVanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without\nevaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\nthe truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\nshould he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\n\nSomebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\n'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\nMa'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\nexist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\n\nYou imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\nway to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been\nused by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\nUnion into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they\nwould not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are\nclearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be\nvery happy if you could convince me that what I am told about\nIsrael were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.\nI suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest\ndiscussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\n\nI hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: spork@camelot.bradley.edu (Richard Izzo)\nSubject: Re: Royals\nNntp-Posting-Host: camelot.bradley.edu\nOrganization: Bradley University\nDistribution: na\nLines: 20\n\nIn <randall.734911319@moose> randall@informix.com (Randall Rhea) writes:\n\n>The Royals are darkness.

In my office was my\nreloading bench.  On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was \nabout 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand\nprimers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20\nand .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the \nreloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2\" of char on\nthe joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other\nwords.\n\nNone of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited.\nNo explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do.\nThe black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids\ncompletely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was\ncontained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred\nbadly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case\nof the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away.\n\nMany of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood\non all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the\nrifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were\nfound still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into \nthe wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually\ndislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets.\nThe .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around.\nNo dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets\nleft the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard.\n\nOrdinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless\nof what the FBI says.  \n\nJohn\n\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?\n"}, {"text": "From: psyrobtw@ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.edu (Robert Weiss)\nSubject: 25 Apr 93   God's Promise in Psalm 56:4\nOrganization: University at Buffalo\nLines: 9\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41\nNntp-Posting-Host: ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.edu\n\n\n\n\tIn God,\n\twhose word I praise,\n\tin God I trust;\n\tI will not be afraid.\n\tWhat can mortal man do to me?\n\n\tPsalm 56:4 (NIV)\n"}, {"text": "From: henry@zoo.toronto.edu (Henry Spencer)\nSubject: Re: Orion drive in vacuum -- how?\nOrganization: U of Toronto Zoology\nLines: 15\n\nIn article <1qn4bgINN4s7@mimi.UU.NET> goltz@mimi.UU.NET (James P.

I moved there from\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\n\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \ntold me, \"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \nhour.\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \neven considered such an idea possible.\n\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\" I didn't \nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\n\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn't \nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\nArmenian SSR.\n\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\n\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You're in bed? You don't \nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \nI said, \"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\n\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\n\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there's a crowd out \nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\n\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \ndon't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\n\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it's true, \ndefended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\n\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don't \nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\n\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \napartments. Something on the order of \"We'll move the Armenians out and take \nover their apartments.\"\n\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\n\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \ninvolved.\n\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I'll get you \nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\n\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\n\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\" His \nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can't go because \nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\n\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\n\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \nArmenian?\"\n\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\nI told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \nthen?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \nlaughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \nThat's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\n\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \nthe information into the urn.\"\n\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\n\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I'm speaking \nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\nAnd I say, \"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \nhe really thinks it's an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \naffair.\n\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn't\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don't know, \nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn't expect that you would\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\n\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you've got another\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you're finally starting to \ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\n\n  April 20, 1988\n  Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

You should\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \n complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)\n you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\n\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\n  \n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\n\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\n \n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\n are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine \n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\n The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'\n  \n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\n \n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \n\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\n \n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\n\n   -- Ron Roth --\n =====================================================================\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\n\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.\n---\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363\n"}, {"text": "From: mossman@cea.Berkeley.EDU (Amy Mossman)\nSubject: Re: Is MSG sensitivity superstition?\nOrganization: CEA\nLines: 31\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: mania.cea.berkeley.edu\n\nIn article <1993Apr15.135941.16105@lmpsbbs.comm.mot.com>, dougb@comm.mot.com (Doug Bank) writes:\n|> \n|> Here is another anecdotal story.

It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?

Those who subscribe to\n_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone\ncomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the\ncontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads\nis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the\nfamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.\nThe letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that\nNefertiti was \"a beautiful black queen.\"  This set off an exchange of\nhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had\nan article from an Egyptologist titled \"Was Cleopatra Black?\"  (The answer\nto the title is \"no\"-- she was greek.)\n\nI have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I\npersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in\nWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary\nenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark\nhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and\ndown the Mediterranean.\n\n(Also, if what I remember is correct, the \"Black Madonna\" doesn't represent\na person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe\nBuehler....?)\n\nIn the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that\ngreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,\nthe situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,\nor various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about\nthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then\nthere are the Ethiopians....\n\nThose of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these\npeople are \"white\" (i.e., of the racist's \"race\").  If I may risk a\npotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the\nidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering\nthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval\nantisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \"Jesus was white\" thesis\never played the roles that some hold it did.\n\nRepresentations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems\nawfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.\n-- \nC.

The number of characters\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\nX\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:\t1993\nXfix:\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\nXtitle:\ttitle of entry  \t\t    (see comments below)\nXentry:\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\nXdate:\tDate/time of submission in UTC\t    (see comments below)\nXhost:\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\nX\tUse tab indented lines if needed\nX---remark---\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\nX---author---\nXname:\tyour name\nXorg:\tSchool/Company/Organization\nXaddr:\tpostal address\nX\tuse tab indented lines to continue\nX\tdon't forget to include the country\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\nXanon:\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\nX---info---\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\nX---build---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\nX---program---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\nXinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\nX---end---\nX\nX      Regarding the above format:\nX\nX\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\nX\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\nX\nX\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\nX\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\nX\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\nX\nX\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\nX\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()\nX\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\nX\nX\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\nX\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the\nX\t  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same\nX\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be\nX\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\nX\nX\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above\nX\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\nX\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\nX\t  Email message to the judges.\nX\nX\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless\nX\t  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.\nX\nX\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\nX\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX\t* The entry's remarks should include:\nX\t    - what this program does\nX\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX\t    - information about any ---data--- files\nX\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX\t* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They\nX\t  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple\nX\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed\nX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by '.c'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not\nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is\nX       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:\nX\nX\t\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate\nX\t\tobfuscate@toad.com\nX\nX       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.\nX\nX       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries\nX       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->\t\t      |\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be 'old' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the\nX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We\nX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |\nX    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |\nX    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.\t      |\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)\nX\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of\nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You\nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    'hints' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many\nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

Also, exact part\n|> numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!\n\nThe first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional\nor not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or\ninput presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively\ncoupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and\nfrom the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any\ncoupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.\n\nIf the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than\njust coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before\nswitching with coupling capacitors of your own.\n\nIf you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input\nthrough to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching\nwhere for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch\nchange. This may mask the switch click.\n\nAn audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and\nmaking your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)\nsealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles\nuse this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes\na complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.\nRadio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.\n\nFor a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try \nlooking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its\nolder predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed\nprior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete\nand IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).\nAll the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily\nmake a subject for a multi-page article.\n\nSolid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on\ndue to charge being injected into the audio line through device\ncapacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to\nminimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through\nthe switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the\ncontrol pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as\nputting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.\n\nHope this helps at least get you started.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\n"}, {"text": "From: dtate+@pitt.edu (David M.

Last summer I\ncouldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden\nbefore one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice\non how to repel wasps.\n\n   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one\nof my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care\nof them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we\ncouldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest\nin my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie\nfor the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or\nspread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards?\nNever mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved\nplants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone\nelse.\n\n   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem\nto come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in\nthem. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon\nas the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.\n\nEven when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they\nseem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about\nwasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful\nstings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use\nhygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me,\nand come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd.

Where Luke (1:17) reports\nthe angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ \"in the \npower and spirit of Elias\", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,\n   \n   \"And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who\n    was to come\".\n\nIt is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, \"If you care to accept\nit\", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein-\ncarnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it\nis.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other\ntopics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of\nreincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews\ntoday, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah\nHurnard (\"Hinds Feet on High Places\") was told about it by a Rabbi\nshe was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.\nThus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,\nwhereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about \nJohn, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded\nbut nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one\nway or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general\nof the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are \noccasional indications that point to it.\n\nAs for the \"popular belief\" that Elijah would come again, it was more than \na popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never \ncorrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought \nthat Jesus himself be he.\n\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\n"}, {"text": "From: cdt@sw.stratus.com (C.

There\n>are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\n>reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\n\nMichael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian\nglasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the\nNT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some\npoints in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly \nabrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with\nadequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew,\nand probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )\n\nThis part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:\n\nmls> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n>No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \n>seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\n>gospel.\n\nRussell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate.\nMichael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, \nwhich seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are \npossible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton\nwas a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis\nwas a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?\n\nmls> ...

More\ndirect, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?'\nThe implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the \ntradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition.
