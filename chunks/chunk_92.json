I've seen red mask,\nbut most that I've seen are green.\n\nA bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder mask\nis put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side\n(or just one side) of the board.\nA fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the green\nsolder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglass\nboard with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.\nTeflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.\n\nI'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they're\nnot about to change. Also, any change in any chemical probably requires\na better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards.

Only those of them whom age has deprived of any\ncharm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to\nmiscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they\nwho oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend\nto refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently.\nLet us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds.\nAnd preserve us in any case from their good ones.\"\n\n(Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam, \np. 118).\n\nI wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM)\nviewpoint though.

If anything, one could claim that,\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\n\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\n\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\nsalvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\nmartyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.\n\nZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from\nMazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The\netymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name,\nas uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else-\nwhere. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the\nGreek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old\nIranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht,\nseveral Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.\nWe can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra,\nmeans \"camel.\" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used\ntraditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when\nZarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into\ncommon use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books\nof Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]\n  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in\nWestern culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented,\nand heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"),\nattributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the\nAvesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha\nSpentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha\nVashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the\nprophet's death.\n  Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger\nAvesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the\nPahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid\ninscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is\nmentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who\nseems unaware of him).\n  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true\nchronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect\nway, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose\nwas not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the\nother hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra,\nalthough from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him\nsix thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus,\nHermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The\naccount by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean\nsix hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes\nagainst Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes\nreference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut\nHumbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it\nis generally rejected.\n  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are\nnonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history\nof the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as\nthe above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time\nZarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an\nextremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet\ncould not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close\nto, that of the Achaemenids.\n  Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono-\nlogy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord-\ning to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.\nAgain, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as\nhistorically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical\njustification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the\nlatter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface\nbecause it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed\nby Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the\nbeginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex\nproblems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the\npart of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this\ncontext, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after\nthe beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and\nVishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium\n(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).\n  Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to\nreconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally\non the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus\nthe Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the\ngreat political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of\nthe first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that\nperiod, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same\ntime, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be\njustified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara-\nthushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the\nmost legitimate.\n  As to Zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of\nvalid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that\nhe was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra\nwith Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language\nof the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose,\nboth on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east,\neven though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable\nvariety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view\nthat he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian\nregion, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however,\nZarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the\nHindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia\n(modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would\nthus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.\n  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna\n33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a\nspecific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned\nreligious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an\nathravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly\ncaste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used\nto lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the\nproduct of a great and original ethical mind.\n  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India\nto Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan,\nor \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks\ntruth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate -\nand blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision\nof asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the\n\"vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this\nlanguage lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian\nmysticism.\n  Zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a\nparticular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength\nof his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force-\nfully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic\nmonotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the\nevil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl.,\nFrashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti] \n  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological\ndoctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi-\ntions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic\nand ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem\nof evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward\nreligiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi-\ntion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.\n  Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy to\nunderstand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the\ncomplex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the\nAmesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\" These are spiritualizations of the\nabstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous\ndevotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a\nsystem of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the\nmanifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]\n  Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"),\nand of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of\nZarathushtra's life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.\nAccording to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at\nthirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful\ninspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did\nhe succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was\nstrongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly\ngroups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility\ncaused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of\nKavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with\nhis wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two\nyears old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"),\nand of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more\nsons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of\nhis second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good\ncattle\") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned:\nFrashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi's father, and the latter as the\nhusband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"),\nwhose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again,\naccording to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was\nassassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the\nTuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi\nform).\n  The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi-\ntion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian\ncommunities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of\nthe Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as\npassages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth\ncentury, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i\nBahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about\nZarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the\nperfect man.\n  Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the\nRenaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic\nperiods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien\nwisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer,\npsychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the\ninfluence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always\nopenly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and\nadvocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as\na precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the\nbiblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural\nsign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three\nMagi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is\nderived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the\nFuture. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the\nSasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the\nspread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra's popularity in the\nChristian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised\noften by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three\ngreat messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture\nand heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss-\nance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara-\nthushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was\nviewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean\nOracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a\npossible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in\nVoltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.\n  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave\nthe name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883-\n1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the\ntrue motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between\ngood and evil.

The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur's discovery stood.

His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the \"Newton of mirror-image life,\" which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand\nhim and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that\n\"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\ncertain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\n\n|> \n|> Define \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\n|> Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\n|> faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\n|> guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\n|> in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to\n|> 3-round burst-fire.

With a single hand you either\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\n\n\n|> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n|>   to rotate to the next round.\n\nI'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\nround - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\non a misfire takes very little time.\n\n\n|> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n|>   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n|>   easy motion, even one handed.\n\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\nnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and\nat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the\nround to set it off.\n\n|> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n|>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \ntake more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\nstill be used if needed later).  \n\n|> \n|> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n|>   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\n|>   lost as you realize \"hey, it's jammed!\" before starting to do anything\n|>   about clearing it.\n\nYes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear\nit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\n\n\n|> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n|>   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \n|>   chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\n|>   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\n|>   of employment as a revolver.\n\n|> - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n|>   operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nAll common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any\nsafety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets\nyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.\n\n|> \n|> Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\n|> switching many officers back to the old revolvers.

I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver\nfor safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all\nyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger\nfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that\nnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and\nrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew\noff your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.\n\n|> \n|> Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\n|> the police don't know nothing about firearms.

The dear old aunt (now \ndeceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially\ndevout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in\nAustria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her\nabout politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would \nbe a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.\n\nWithin two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite\nme over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to\nexpect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got,\nhowever, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion\nwas to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling \nin federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization\nof minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on\nthe ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy,\n\"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\"\n\nThe crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of\n\"overpopulation,\" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed\nmothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this\nis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to \nbring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus\nand admonish me against converting to Judaism, \"because it involves\ntoo much study and effort.\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor\ntry to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no\nJewish proselytism going on there.\n\nAnd again, last November I toured a \"traditional\" Jewish synagogue and was\nsubjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in\ngeneral.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the\nbest supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience,\nthe modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.\n\n \n-- \nboundary\n\nno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he\nvenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina) \n"}, {"text": "From: da228@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Charles G.

These finer particles are considered hazardous because \nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \nAssociation's medical section.  \n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \nand bronchitis in children.  \n     \"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\" \nsays Dr. Schwartz.  \"But more and more research is showing that particles are \nbad actors as well.\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nacid aerosols.  \n     \"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \nof particulate air pollution,\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \"We have no way of \nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \" Consequently, most of what \nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \nlike the Seattle study.  \n     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\n     \"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's \nrarely particulate matter,\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \"However, PM10 doesn't have \nto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma\n\nThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on \nDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in \ndermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance \ntechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care \nprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological \ncharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, \nand followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi \nand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in \npreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.

Within the program, there are four types \nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \nclinical research; \"comprehensive\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \nprevention and control research. \n \nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened \nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew \nprogressively. \n \nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \nfor comprehensive status. \n \nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for \"comprehensiveness\" include the \nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \ninto clinical practice. \n \nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \nthe infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass \nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \nsources. \n \nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \n \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \n \nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \n \nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \n \nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \n \nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \n \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\n1918 University Boulevard\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\n(205) 934-6612\n \nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\nTucson, Arizona 85724\n(602) 626-6372\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\n \nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\n200 Medical Plaza\nLos Angeles, California 90027\n(213) 206-0278\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\n \nKenneth T.

The \ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's \nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the \nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \n\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\" said Shalala.   \nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \nyears.\n\n==================================================================    \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. \n114, No. 14, P. 18 \n\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, \nthe manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the \ndrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \ndrug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. \nresearchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, \nmany argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients \nexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  \nAIDS symptoms.

I took me a long time to come\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\nsome 'rosicrucians' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThis makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions.\nThere is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people\nwho call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually\n*BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important\nrequirements about not belonging to other 'religions'.  I find that\nthe ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be\ninterpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that\n'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial\nPhilosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>\n\n\nTony:\n\nI'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\n\n\nResponse:\n\nCertainly true.  I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves\n'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC.  Sure, I've heard all the\nhubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these\nWestern esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'.\nI'll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>\n\n\nTony:\n\n\"You'll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \n\n\nResponse:\n\nThis may be slightly off.  I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have\na couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I've heard and the slight contact\nI've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with\nany kind of warm welcome.  I still like to think that most people who\nare involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.)\nare in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'.\n\n\nTony:\n\n     \nIt is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-\nsectarian*.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nI'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call \nthemselves 'Rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'.\nIs this 'nonsectarian' like the Masons, who require that a member 'believe\nin God by his/her definition'?\n\n     \n     \nTony:\n\nI don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with \"us containing\nsomething divine\"...
