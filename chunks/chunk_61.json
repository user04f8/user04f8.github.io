Any back-\ndoors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help grow\nthe market demand for a secure alternative.\n\n I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make\nfew friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that\nthe government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal.\nI expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability\nof such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of\ncertain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.\n\nRegards,\nIan Ameline.\n(Of course the ramblings above have nothing to do with my employer, nor\ndo I necessarily advocate doing any of the things described here -- I\njust believe that the events above are likely to take place)\n"}, {"text": "From: bauer@informatik.uni-ulm.de (Christian Bauer)\nSubject: Re: Q700 at 34.5MHz, it's fine...\nNntp-Posting-Host: christian.informatik.uni-ulm.de\nOrganization: University of Ulm\nLines: 23\n\nIn article <lee5.734735026@husc.harvard.edu>, lee5@husc8.harvard.edu\n(Patrick Lee) wrote:\n> \n> menes@Informatik.TU-Muenchen.DE (Rainer Menes) writes:\n> \n> \n> >I wonder why nobody has ever tried to replace the oscilator only, like on a Mac IIsi.

(There's a gripe in the industry\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \n\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \n\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Nagle\n"}, {"text": "From: radley@gibbs.oit.unc.edu (Keith Radley)\nSubject: Electronics\nSummary: new address\nNntp-Posting-Host: gibbs.oit.unc.edu\nOrganization: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 21\n\n \nPanasonic KX-T3000H, Combo black cordless & speaker phone all in one.\n new- $160, now- $100 + shipping OBO.\n \nCurtis Mathes VHS VCR Remote included and it works with universal remotes.\n Works great but I replaced it with a Stereo VCR.\n paid $300 years ago, will sell for $125 delivered OBO.\n \nRadio Shack stereo amp.  2 inputs, tone, and left and right volume.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.

He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n\"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.\"  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.

Some new\ndrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data\nwrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform\na test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical\ntolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*\ntrack drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This\nbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and\nso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it\nseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of\nboosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.\n\nI first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed\nout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when\ndigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers\nexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT\nto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nVictor\n"}, {"text": "From: moore@halley.est.3m.com (Richard Moore)\nSubject: Re: X interactive performance\nIn-reply-to: afielden@cbnewsb.cb.att.com's message of Mon, 26 Apr 1993 14:20:40 GMT\nOrganization: 3M Company, 3M Center, Minnesota, USA\nLines: 4\n\nFor image display, about 10 frames per second seems to be the lower limit\nfor interactive operations.

And remember, I am with you always, to the end\nof the age.\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]\n\nThe notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\n\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there\nforced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged\ndictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|David R. Tucker\t\tKG2S\t\t     drt@athena.mit.edu|\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\n\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\n\nThose who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.\n\n--clh]\n"}, {"text": "From: hsteve@carina.unm.edu ()\nSubject: Re: interface to access separate appl.\nOrganization: University of New Mexico, Albuquerque\nLines: 27\nNNTP-Posting-Host: carina.unm.edu\n\nIn article <9304121644.AA27256@expo.lcs.mit.edu> DBOHDAL@JAGUAR.ESS.HARRIS.COM writes:\n<Dear Xperts:\n<\n<   Here's my problem:  I am designing several related X \n<applications (each one is a separate executable) and  I'd like \n<to build a single control window that would allow the user to \n<access each application (instead of having to locate the correct\n<icon).

(They do account for a somewhat larger\nportion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)\n\nSome facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of\ntotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of \nphysicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged\npaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  \nMalpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;\nthey've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health\ncare costs have increased more than any period in history.\n\nAs far as \"defensive medicine\" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its\ntotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total\ncurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group\nthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine\non health care.\n\nAs small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,\nClinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification\nof MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their\nspecialties.

Bede is a great\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\nnot make it more so.\n\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\nFestival.\"\n\nHowever, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\n\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n\n\n[No, I'm not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety\nof celebrating Easter.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

Alexander Mogilny led the\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\nLaFontaine all night.\n\nRoster move:\n\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\nscratch.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-McGill\n\nTommy Soderstrom\n\nGame Summary:\n\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\n\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\nhe was getting bored back there...\n\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\n\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\ndidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\n\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\nRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\nnext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\nend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\n\nHe's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\nfour years if there was a consensus.\n\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tEric Lindros\t74 1992-93\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tMark Recchi\t121 1992-93*\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t52 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t121\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t84\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t62\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t59\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner\n\n"}, {"text": "From: elliott@optilink.COM (Paul Elliott)\nSubject: Re: Analog switches/Balanced Demodulators\nDistribution: na\nOrganization: DSC/Optilink Access Products\nLines: 53\n\nIn article <msf.734832494@skaro> msf@skaro.as.arizona.edu (Michael Fulbright) writes:\n>I am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and I've hit a snag.\n>In my application I want to be able to change the gain of an\n>op amp amplifier from 1 to -1, controlable via a digital input.\n>The most obvious way I've come up with is to use analog switches\n>to adjust the gain of the op amp.

You all are an insult to you race!\n{assuming you are also semitic}\n\tNow I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism\nduring the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -\noff militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of\nPalestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\nterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\nArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\nvery lives.\n\tI mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\nIsraelites pisses me off so.

You have to\nprovide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is\nCopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't\nmatch its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a\nborder-pixel, and the problem should go away.\n\nThere is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that\nCopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to\nXCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines\nCopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so\nyou are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib\nimplementation not providing stricter type-checking.
