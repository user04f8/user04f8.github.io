It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling\nto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing\nthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is\nGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go\nby the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\"\nused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then\nassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it\nis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.\n\nHmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how\nGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that\nif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one\namongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.\n\nSo why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE\nANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to \njustify jabbering.\n\nBut I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.\n\nTrouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at\nverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that\nthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright\nfabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post\nseems like a \"friend of a friend\" thing.  And linguistically, a two\nsyllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.\n\nMuch as many faith healers have trouble proving their \"victories\" (since\nmost ailments \"cured\" are just plain unprovable) and modern day\nressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that no\nmodern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.\n"}, {"text": "From: hl00@ns1.cc.lehigh.edu (HOU-SHENG LIN)\nSubject: Laser vs Bubblejet?\nOrganization: Lehigh University\nLines: 12\n\nWell, I'm not too sure if this would be the right place to post this, but\nanyway, here goes:  I was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet\nprinters offers up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of lower end laser\nprinters only offer 300x300.

Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.

Most of my friends\nare anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions\non facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the\ncontrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world\nmore civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They \nwould rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how\nsociety has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They \nsupport spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum\nwho have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society\nor its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun\ncontrol (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun\ncontrol (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they\nhave to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront\nthe fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that\nare causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't\naccept that!

Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system\nas well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller\npercentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost\nwon. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters\ninto our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in\nreturn for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than\n30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it\nwas twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for\nrent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.\nSome 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees\nin technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%\nunemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used\ncar if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you\ncould afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and\nnot consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies,\nno entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've\nsaved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your\nkids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri\noutright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an\nexaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other\npeople's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also\nbuy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping\nin a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter.

Extra is kept for\nthe future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that\nsupports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant\ncrops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If\nyou want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a\ngood job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something\nelse. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the\npublic holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with\nanybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the\nuse of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient\nto the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house\nand yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow\nto live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness\nsubject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no\nmore than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a\ndeep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger\nhouse or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan\nand community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public\ngood or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and\nmaintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in\nservice to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided\namong the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid\noperators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy\nmachine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their\ncouncil is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn't\nso hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is\nrealize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's a\nrigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could\nbe already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been\nmaking the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the\nmerry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted\nyour 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones\nwho always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when\nyou get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but\nkilled for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a\npoor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying\nthe death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed\ntheir greed! Have you paid rent most of your life?

Now we\nare called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own\nland they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to\nown it.

We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\n\n\nDan Snodgrass\nMedia Services\nLewis & Clark College\nPortland\n"}, {"text": "From: andy@SAIL.Stanford.EDU (Andy Freeman)\nSubject: Re: That silly outdated Bill (was Re: Koresh and Miranda)\nOrganization: Computer Science Department,  Stanford University.\nLines: 52\n\nIn article <1qibs0$flk@vela.acs.oakland.edu> awesley@vela.acs.oakland.edu (awesley) writes:\n>In article <1993Apr14.225910.14964@CSD-NewsHost.Stanford.EDU> andy@SAIL.Stanford.EDU (Andy Freeman) writes:\ni]>>Since there was no sniper fire, doing nothing was equally effective,\n>>as was yelling \"stop that\".

Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot.\n\nThat said, I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side\nof this coin, namely the love of righteousness.  In the Beatitudes,\nJesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness.  In\nthe New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one should\nalways actively desire and work for the cause of good.  In that sense,\nit should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its\nvictims, even when these are its accomplices as well.\n\nMaybe \"mourn sin, love sinners\" catches the idea slightly better than\n\"hate\", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passive\npowerless position.  A balanced Christian response needs grief, love,\nand carefully measured, constructive anger.  Jesus has all three.  The\nEuropean pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was\ndevoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love or\ngrief they exemplified.\n\nMy sister is an actress in New York and a Christian.  A few years\nback, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died of\nAIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, and\nabandoned by most of his surviving friends.  Only my sister and\nbrother-in-law were there with him at the very end.  In her grief over\nJack's death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callous\nbureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack's family,\nthe inertia in Christians' response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jack's own\nlapse in morality that eventually cost him his life.  Jack himself\nshared that last anger.  Brought up with strong Christian values, he\nwas contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before\nhis AIDS appeared.

But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.]\n\n\nSo what you're saying then, is that God exercises direct control, or\ninfluence upon humanity. He doesn't control our every thought or action,\nbut takes what we do, whether it be intended for evil or not, and turns\nit into something good. It seems to me, that this idea conflicts with\nthe belief that God gave humans FREE WILL. As far as I can determine,\nit is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas. If God were to\nexert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime, he would be \nimpeding upon someone's free will. Unless, of course, you believe that\nGod did not give us complete and unabated free will, but rather, some sort\nof conditional free will. Something that allows us to make our own choices\nand control our own lives except when God wants to use us to fulfill some\ngood purpose of his own by \"hardening our heart\" or controlling us in some\nother way. I hear alot of people who look at various events, mostly \ncatastrophies or things like the AIDS epidemic and make comments about\nGod's will. I have a very difficult time understanding why people believe\nthat God controls anything that happens on this planet. Except, possibly\nwhen being asked to through someone's prayer. According to the Bible,\nPharoah was going to let Moses' people go after one or two plagues, but\nGod kept hardening his heart so Moses could cast all 7 plagues upon the\nEgyptians, the last plague causing the death of many innocent children.\nSo then, God impeded upon Pharoah's free will and used him as a puppet.\nGod did this not just to free the Hebrews, but to free them in some sort\nof a grand fashion. I suppose from the Hebrew's point of view, this could\nbe seen as turning something bad into good, but I'm sure the Egyptians didn't\nsee it this way. All of your examples of how God turned something bad into\nsomething good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over\nanother. After all, it's only good based upon your point of view.

We are in the middle of\nthe genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another \"green light\"\nto.  Mladic seems to have most of what he wants, but Boban is just\ngetting his appetite whetted. Because Mladic refuses to allow\ninternational observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers\nin places like Foca, Brcko, and Visegrad, it will be years before we have\nan accurate account of the number killed. \n\nIn practical terms, it would be impossible to kill all 2,000,000.  There\njust isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and\ntransportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop.  And\nremember, the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied.  To\nactually kill 42% of the population requires extreme genocidal\norganization.   \n\nBut I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic\nannihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture, by killing as many as is\nfeasible, by rape, by torture, by the demolition of mosques, libraries,\nand culture artificts, the burning and renaming of villages, the shelling\nof civilians.  So that there won't be any of the 2,000,000 or so Muslims\nwhose lives have not been shattered by the genocide, though they still\nmay be alive.\n\nAnd Mr. Major not only finds this acceptable, he helps it along by making\nsure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves.\n>\n>-Nick\n>\nMike.\n--\nMichael Sells, Department of Religion, Haverford College\nHaverford, Pa 19041-1392\n"}, {"text": "From: timlin@spot.Colorado.EDU (Michael Timlin)\nSubject: Re: Expanded NL Strike Zone?

For\ninstance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a\nplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the\ncontention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if\nthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\ncontent;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\ntalk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?
