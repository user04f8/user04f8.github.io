That's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts\nof people.\n\n\tWhat's needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone\nquality speech<->RS232 converter. Imagine, if you will, a little box that\ntakes data on its serial port and puts out sound, and takes sound and codes\nit to signals on its serial port. Full duplex. Now, this device is not a\ncryptographic device. It's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whatever\nyou want to call it. It's got loads of perfectly legitimate applications\nfor:\n\ta) speech synthesis (with a few nifty libraries and some samples)\n\tb) speech recording for electronic messaging\n\tc) building voicemail systems\n\td) internet talk radio\n\te) internet relay chat\n\n\tOf course, some of the electronic messaging in item b might be\nencrypted, possibly realtime, but that's the user's decision. One would\nneed 2 of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout\nto switch over, and some code on, say, a 486 laptop.\n\n\tI'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive\ninternet talk radio could be done. Ideally, though, it should be a general\npurpose device. It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody\nshould be able to balk at its widespread use. Obviously, to make it easy\nfor homebrewers, it should use pretty common hardware.\n\n\tIt's interesting to note that I'd already talked with a couple\nof folks about building such a thing, before this whole clipper thing\nstarted. I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are\nable to make sample units, given incentive and some time. I'd envisioned\nfinding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund\ndevelopment of a public domain board layout and parts set, that could\nbe published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CAD\npackages, and in PostScript.\n\n\tAnyone interested? I'll start a provisional mailing list. Let\nme know if you want on.\n\nmjr.\n"}, {"text": "From: cdt@sw.stratus.com (C. D.

It would \n          violate the \"laws\" of physics.  All of the \"experts\" and \n          \"authorities\" said so. \n          \n               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  \"The \n          demonstration that no possible combination of known \n          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of \n          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man \n          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer \n          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any \n          physical fact to be.\" \n          \n               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright \n          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final \n          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they \n          crash). \n          \n               Today, orthodox physicists and other \"scientists\" are \n          saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy' \n          Technologies, using negative terms such as \"pseudo-science\" \n          and \"perpetual motion\", and citing so-called \"laws\" which \n          assert that \"energy cannot be created or destroyed\" (\"1st law \n          of thermodynamics\") and \"there is always a decrease in useful \n          energy\" (\"2nd law of thermodynamics\").  The physicists do not \n          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare \n          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF \n          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern \"science\" and help to \n          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox \n          modern theories. \n          \n               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a \n          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-\n          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT \n          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated \n          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. \n          \n               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, \n          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by \n          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, \n          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they \n          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy \n          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by \n          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced \n          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and \n          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and \n          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are \n          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly \n          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. \n          \n               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, \n          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for \n          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly \n          tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic \n          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to \n          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in \n          \"Science & Mechanics\" magazine, Spring 1980, (\"Amazing \n          Magnet-Powered Motor\", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, \n          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, \n          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such \n          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible \n          heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.

They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit \n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \n          'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to \n          'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in \n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER' \n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \n          Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the \n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [\"Earth Energy: \n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\", by John Bigelow, 1976, \n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \n          \n               During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named \n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \n          'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after \n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book \"A \n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\", by Dan A. Davidson, \n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \n          which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC \n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \n          of the earth's rotation, via the 'Coriolis effect', LIKE A \n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \n          \n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock \n          Air Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \n          \n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \n          common household smoke detector. \n          \n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \n          reactor which he calls 'Migma', which uses NON-radioactive \n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \n          \"Tokamaks\" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \n          for every watt put in.  [\"New Times\" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \n          pages 32-40.] \n          \n               And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that \n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \n          \n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called \"laws\" \n          of thermodynamics are NOT so \"absolute\".  For example, the \n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the 'Reciprocal System', (which he describes in detail \n          in several books such as \"Nothing But Motion\" (1979) and \"The \n          Universe of Motion\" (1984)), in which the physical universe \n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \n          between them, with-OUT the \"heat death\" predicted by \n          thermodynamic \"laws\".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \n          seemingly converting \"low-quality energy\" into \"high-quality \n          energy\". \n          \n               Also, certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat' \n          and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe \n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \n          channels, as described in books like \"The Path of the \n          Masters\", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and \"Eckankar: The Key \n          to Secret Worlds\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \n          called the 'Astral Plane'.  Long-time Members of these groups \n          have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and \n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \n          those described in the book \"Psychic Discoveries Behind the \n          Iron Curtain\". \n          \n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors \n          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop \n          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional \n          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their \n          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If \n          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of \n          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and \n          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and \n          pollution and its harmful effects (including the 'GREENHOUSE \n          EFFECT', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil \n          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue \n          to increase. \n          \n               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development \n          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize \n          private production (until the producers can make it on their \n          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of \n          Free Energy Hardware. \n          \n               The long-range effects of such government intervention \n          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy \n          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining \n          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, \n          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to \n          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR's, \n          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that \n          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, \n          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be \n          able to realize the \"opportunity costs\" of paying electric \n          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would \n          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to \n          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government \n          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be \n          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE \n          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. \n          \n               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of \n          business, but society as a whole, and the earth's environment \n          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.

In the mid-80's, they ran a \"One \nMillion Strong!\" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.  \nMy understanding is that they \"reached\" it by the stratagem of including\nwide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak\nauthoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they\nstarted running a \"Two Million Strong!\" campaign for a while -- but they\nlet it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they\nsimply were never going to reach that level of membership.\n\nIn 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting\npoint of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  \nBy 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had \nabout a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the\nthird largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).\nAnd its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical\nfigures from Kukla's \"Gun Control,\" pp. 61 and 420.)\n\nAs you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused\nby their T-bones and MTV.

Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary.\"\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] \"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] \"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion.\"\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

I assumed that heresy\nmeant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is\nindeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word \"create\"\nis of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.\n\n>\n>     Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created\n>     and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \"granted the Mormon\n>     belief...\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to\n>     have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address\n>     and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the\n>     conclusion that you grant.\n\n  I should have said \"given the Mormon belief.\"  If you disagree with the\nMormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally\nexistent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important\npoint.\n\n>     The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus\n>     is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS\n>     belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.\n\n  Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by\nsuch terms.\n\n>     The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is\n>     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\n>     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\n>\n   It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they\nbelieve.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and\nLucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or\norganized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being \"offspring\" of\nGod has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \"born again\" of\nHim.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is\nhow language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a\nword is dangerous.\n\n\n>     This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but\n>     rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read\n>     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.

You say\nthat one must simply \"look at the Bible\" to see what it teaches, but centuries\nof people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says.\nAre we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the\nscriptures?\n\n>     I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is\n>     that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late\n>     apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the\n>     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \"I\n>     have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.\n\n  Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief\nthat Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We\nkeep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of\nMormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)\n\n>\n>     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\n>     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't\n>     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the\n>     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\n>     subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may\n>     certainly be.\n\n  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon\ncanon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*\nimportance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate\ngeneral Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large\nnumber of Mormons.\n>\n>\n>=============================\n>Robert Weiss\n>psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu\n--\nRick Anderson  librba@BYUVM.BITNET\n\n"}, {"text": "From: ab245@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Sam Latonia)\nSubject: Re: HELP!

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\n          PHIGS\".\n\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\n          based on PHIGS.\n\n          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.\n\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\n\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\n          mainframes.\n\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\n          and translucency.\n\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\n\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\n\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\n\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\n          Starbase.\n\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render.

Treat it with proper respect, both because it is\n   God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because\n   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not\n   constitute what the Apostle Paul called \"becoming all things to all men so\n   that by all possible means I might save some.\"\n\n   Don't say \"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time\n   on.\" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your\n   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.\n\n2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not\n   creator.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little\n& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as \"dogs\"\n& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized\n& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,\n& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?\n\nMotorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very\ncorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  \"speed shifting\"\n(which is what I have always heard \"clutchless shifting\" called) works\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\n\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of\nsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions\nthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse\nand sometimes first).  \n\n--\nFrank Ball   1UR-M          frankb@sad.hp.com    (707) 794-4168 work,\nHewlett Packard             (707) 794-3844 fax,  (707) 538-3693 home\n1212 Valley House Drive     IT175, XT350, Seca 750, '62 F-100, PL510\nRohnert Park CA 94928-4999  KC6WUG, LAW, AMA, Dod #7566, I'm the NRA.\n"}, {"text": "From: bebmza@sru001.chvpkh.chevron.com (Beverly M.

How's that for an answer?  :-)\nSeriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you are\ntalking about a governmental employer or not.  In this case, I\nbelieve that there should be absolutely no discrimination,\ndirect or indirect, period.  I feel this way not because it would\noffend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), but\nbecause the government is a coercive entity which we cannot\nescape.  It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were\n\"whites only\" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountains\nfor others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains\ncertainly were not applied to \"whites only.\"  In essence, we\ncannot escape the coercive state.

A family sedan designed to be\noperable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\nlarger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family\nsedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the\n*brakes.*\n\nThe Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power\nplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.\nI have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a\nbrick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I\npersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is\ninadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of\nthe car is not up to par.\n\nI picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in\nmind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much\ncheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these\ncars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them\ndrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought\nit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\nthe following to be true:\n\n1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n   far more predictable than most US highways.\n3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n   much higher than 120km/h.\n\nI strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.

The concept of a closed canon would\n>certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand,\n>an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes.\n\nThere are a lot of people running around saying \"God told me this\" and \n\"God told me that\" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others\nheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He\nsaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it was\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\n\n\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn't want it anymore.\"\n\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \n\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" who\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesies\nanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.\nBarnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an \napostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of\nAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet\nbefore he gave them.  \n\nSo prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it \nScripture.  \n\n>Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new\n>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call\n>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with\n>knowledge?\n\nI don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with \nprophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also \nsimilar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies\nin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let another\ntake\" concerning Judas office.\n\nA clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about\nwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel\nabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \n\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.\n\nLink Hudson.\n"}, {"text": "From: cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer)\nSubject: Re: New Study Out On Gay Percentage\nOrganization: Optilink Corporation, Petaluma, CA\nLines: 76\n\nIn article <1993Apr22.165002.18208@galileo.cc.rochester.edu>, as010b@uhura.cc.rochester.edu (Tree of Schnopia) writes:\n> In <15501@optilink.COM> cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer) writes:\n# #I used to think that homosexuals were OK -- but havng now gotten a\n# #chance through USENET to know quite a few, I've realized that I was\n# #misled in my youth.

The more specific you\nare, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without\nall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are\nable to respond at all.\n\n\tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it \nfrom. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,\ngive details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S \nversion for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to \nmention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.\n\n\tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what\nyou expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the \nexact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote \ndoesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary \n(just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?\n\n\tThe trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)\nare publishing more articles on X.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)\n\n\tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the \nofficial X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It \ndescribes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with \nother clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need \nto read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the \nselection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window \nmanager.  Get it either:\n\t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\n\t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \"X Window System\" book\n\t- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \"X Protocol\nReference Manual.\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\n\tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to \nthe efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the \npresentation.\n\n[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\n\n\t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's\n\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\". The complete document is on the R5\ntapes.\n\n\tAlternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \"RTFM\" and is\nthe most-important of the least-read X documents.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?\n\n\tThe MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the\ndevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of \ncooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software \ninterfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.\n\tMIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and \nadministrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the \nConsortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, \nMember (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\n\tMost of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, \nwith meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,\ninterest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  \nTypically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with \nothers acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification\nis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium\nas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public \nreview (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\n\tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or \nAffiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\n\tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer \nScience, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.\n\n[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4\ndistribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\n\n\tOPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK\nwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was\ndeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF \nmembers. \n\n\tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; \nthere are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.\nMotif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the \none from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce \nprograms which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's \n(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in the\nstyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.\n\n\tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising \ntheir OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.\n\n[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\n\n\tOpen Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system \nthat combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface \nspecification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including\nthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and\na number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).\n\n[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\n\n\tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI \ntoolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a \nsession manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, \ndxpsview, etc.).\n\n(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)\n[8/90] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  15)  What is PEX?\n\n\tPEX is the \"PHiGS Extension to X\".\n\tPHiGS stands for \"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics \nSystem\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation \nand manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in \nhardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension \nallows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized \nhardware for 3D graphics.\n\tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely \nredistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample\nimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \ntheir workstations and X terminals.\n\n[last modified 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\n\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\n\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \n\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do \nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\n\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\n\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \npseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\n   (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \n\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \n\tconnected), and\n   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\n\thave to cross the serial interface, and\n   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \n\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \n\tblocks to compress.\n\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \nNCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \nimplementation available in R6.\n\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\nin contrib/ in the following files:\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\n\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\n\n\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\n\n\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\n\n\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\n\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\n\ttwm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\nre-parenting window manager. \n\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\n\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \n\trtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\n\tdxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\n\thpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\n\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\n\ttekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering \n\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\nGuide functionality\n\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\n\tgwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\n\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\n\tpswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\n\tswm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\nfrom the resources file\n\ttwm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\n\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \nfrom export. [3/92]\n\ttvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\navailable on archive servers\n\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is \navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\n\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\n\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \n\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals \n\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\n\tvuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\n\t4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM\n\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\n\n\tIt needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\n\t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\n\n\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \nLook for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are \nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\n[10/90]\n\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the \nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\napplications and the resource database. \n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?\n\n\tDEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\n\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\n\n\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X\nprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\na capability not supported by all systems.\n\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \nfrom MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the \nkeyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\n\n\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \ndoes not do \"macro expansion.\"\n\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \naccept a translation resource such as:\n\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\n\t\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\ncharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\ncontrol character you want to include.\n\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\nhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an\noncologist.\n\nA bone scan is a nuclear scan.

The tracer is usually given\nintravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will\ninsert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. \n\nAfter a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the\nbody, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high \nconcentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for\nareas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.\n\nAs far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required\nto start the IV line.\n\nWhat the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may\nhave resulted from cancer.

Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow\nhim to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I\nsuspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.\n\nIt is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from\nall perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any\nconclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my\nperspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to\nlife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what\nthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in\nfavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise\nsolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and\ndeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This\nis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own\ndecisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy\nwith current UK abortion law.\n\nSimilarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and\nI really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even\nknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.\n\n\nmathew\n"}, {"text": "From: hps@KEKOA.JACH.HAWAII.EDU (Henry Stilmack - JAC System Mgr.)\nSubject: Choosing a window manager\nReply-To: hps@KEKOA.JACH.HAWAII.EDU\nOrganization: UK/Canada/Netherlands Joint Astronomy Centre, Hilo, Hawaii\nLines: 13\n\nA while back (i.e., several months) someone posted a method for allowing \na user to choose (via XMenu and something else??) a window manager \ninteractively at X startup time.

For the Bruins, it was the stuff of\nnightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  \n   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three\ngames of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a\nbest of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this\ntime.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.\n   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice\nadvantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It\nwasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.\n   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting\ngoaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.\nBuffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on\nthe powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.\nLaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was\nKhmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres\nstole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and\nHannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a\nshot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob\nSweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of\npenalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get\nhis first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes\nlater, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied\nthe game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.\nLast year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet\nrevenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a\ntip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.\nBoth teams finished with 34 shots.  \n        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.\n        Referee--Rob Shick.\n\nComments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of\nclutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic\nagain.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead\nflung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea\nto Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever\nheard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was\nonly five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no\none took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,\nnoted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was\ntoo loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as\nmost of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev\ndidn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't\nskate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each\nwere out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in\nan interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he\nresponed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than\nthat, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).

For those interested in joining, please send e-mail\nto that extend to 'motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl' or 'rvloon@cv.ruu.nl'.\n\nThe blurb everyone who joins gets follows, as well as the original \nannouncement for where Motif++ can be obtained.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n8< - 8< -\n\n\nWelcome to the Motif++ Mailing List!\n\nThe Motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to Motif++, the PD C++\nwrapper library for Motif, where people can ask questions about Motif++, \nswap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the \nbindings. \n\nAll requests of an administrative nature, like subscription, removal, etc.\nshould be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl\n\nAll e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list, so\nplease make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to\nmessages automatically, that the address for the mailing-list is excluded \nfrom auto-replies.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRonald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference \n(rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice.\n3DCV Group, Utrecht |   \nThe Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.\n\n8< - 8< -\n\nHello Motif World,\n\nover the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to\nthe Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have\nbeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.\n\nThis is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will\nincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support\nX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.\n\nNote to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this\ndistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.\n\nHere is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,\nhas developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++\nclasses. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\n\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\n\nNEW RELEASE\n\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\nbindings. \n\nThis release offers:\n\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\n  progress in an application.\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\n\t\t     and its config files on your site. I have tried to\n\t\t     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable\n\t\t     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely\n\t\t     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you\n\t\t     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma\n\t\t     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude\n\t\t     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.\n- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)\n- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted\n  on Usenet.\n\nWHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS\n\nFtp:\n\nAnonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.\n\nNote:\n\nPlease be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large\nfiles during working hours.\n\nAlso note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this\nis an old version of the bindings.\n\nE-mail:\n\nThose who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by\ne-mail.\n\nREQUEST\n\nThose who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please\ncontact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of\nbugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nContact me at \"rvloon@cv.ruu.nl\".\nIf you are desperate, then you can call me at\n+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands\ncall 030-506711).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-- \nRonald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference \n(rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice.\n3DCV Group, Utrecht |   \nThe Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.\n\n"}, {"text": "From: seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.)

Rather I would say\nthat AA (and other 12-step programs) help people come to terms with their\nneeds--ie that AA is facilitating the recovery, and that as part of the\nrecovery, they recognize their spiritual needs, and begin to rely on a \"higher\npower\" (12-step's term) to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse\nthey had been accustomed to.  (Sorry, there is no objective proof here\neither--no way to take 2 identical alcoholics and try to have one recover\nby fulfilling spiritual needs, and one without and externally compare the\ndifference--we are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of\n*people* here.)\n\n>But I should say, if God is a necessary component\n>of your \"spiritual needs\" then I truely do not understand at\n>all. It sounds to me like *spirits* have needs that should be\n>fulfilled by God, but can be \"masked\" in other ways (drugs etc).\n>If this is the case, then you can leave out God: just describe\n>the problem, not the solution.\n>\nSpiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to\nphysical requirements like air, food, sleep, etc.  These are things like\nthe need for love and acceptance, and the need for meaning in life.  If \none denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call \nthese \"emotional needs\". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs \nis that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual \nmeans--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do \nmany meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only be\nsatisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people who\naccept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since I\nbelieve in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the others\nare wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:\n\n1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--ie\nwe all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are \ndeluded--they just haven't recognized it yet.\n\n2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain\nchemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not\nhave such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and \nspiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.\n\nI hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritual\nneeds cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existence\nof God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjective\nevidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I \ncould venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that\nI appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.\n\nI suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and\ndemonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertion\nis that such things are not objectively demonstrable.  As I have said before, \nI myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the \nfence by subjective evidence.  (And no, I was not raised a Christian, so it \nis not a case of simply accepting what I was indoctrinated with.)\n\n==\nSeanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living,\n(seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,\n                                              | God will find his people busy\nOpinion, what opinions?
