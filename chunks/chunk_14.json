After a day or two of work I often find myself down under\n    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than\n    my shell running.\n\n    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some\n    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  \n\n    1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are\n    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at\n    plugging this leak?\n\n    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?\n\n    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with\n    this?

AIRPORT\n\n    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon\n    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI\n    interrogation.\n\nBy Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer\n\nSan Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the\nPhilippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law\nenforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation\nLeague was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police\nsaid Friday.\n\nThomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after\nthe FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday\nnight after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard\nwas returning home.\n\nGerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday\nmorning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count\neach of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.\n\nIf convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and\n$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police\nargued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. \nA friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a\nsheriff's spokeswoman said.\n\nGerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,\nwith whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and \"wanted to have\nhis day in court,\" said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and\none of two arresting officers.\n\nGerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from\n1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett\nsaid.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to\ndisclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he\nwas indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.\n\nGerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network\noperated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil\nrights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave\ncriminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said\nhe has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.\n\nInvestigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's\nhome computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950\ngroups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized\nunder search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los\nAngeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.\n\nGerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,\nJames Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the\ninterview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged\nsnooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any\ncriminal wrongdoing.\n\nBullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling\nintelligence to South Africa.\n\nADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent\ncontractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal\nactivity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest\n\"has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on\nthe case.\"\n\nArab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,\naccording to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to\npursue the investigation.\n\n\"We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly\ndisclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement,\" said\nJames Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.\n\nPolice, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the\ninquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A\nformer police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited\nGerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.\n\n\"I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but\nwe didn't think it would happen this quickly,\" Capt. Willett said. \n\"This development really speeds up our timetable on the case.\"\n\nDuring his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly\nregarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence\ndivision.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.\n\nAfter FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement\nand fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of\nManila.\n\nGerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines\nAirlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard\nafter his six-month hiatus, police said.\n\n\"He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked\nlook on his face,\" Willett said.  \"Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'\"\n \n--\nYigal Arens\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\narens@isi.edu\n"}, {"text": "From: James_Jim_Frazier@cup.portal.com\nSubject: MO driver compatibility?\nOrganization: The Portal System (TM)\nDistribution: world\nLines: 10\n\nIt's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the\nformatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the\ndisc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's\nmemory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible\nwith the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written\nIs that correct?\n\nThanks,\nJim Frazier\n73447.3113@compuserve.com\n"}, {"text": "From: loss@fs7.ECE.CMU.EDU (Doug Loss)\nSubject: Re: Vandalizing the sky.\nOrganization: Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon\nDistribution: na\nLines: 33\n\nIn article <1993Apr27.174622.1@stsci.edu> hathaway@stsci.edu writes:\n>In article <C65LJ5.5Az@fs7.ece.cmu.edu>, loss@fs7.ECE.CMU.EDU (Doug Loss) writes:\n>>    I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, I\n>> just wanted to add a point.\n>> \n>.. \n>> then enforces those rights for them.

It is an S3\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \"Buy the memory\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\n\n\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\"\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie.

It specializes in airframe\ndesign, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.\nVirtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,\nSu, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.\n\nI had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at\nMAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an\nF-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening\nexperience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year\nor so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to\nsee some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines\nfor future space craft use.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would\nbe glad to try and answer them.

Andrew Byler)\n>Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of\n>the Acts of the Apostles can be found?\n\n1] A english translation of this can be found in:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an\n   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance\", J. M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\n\nN\n"}, {"text": "From: John Michael Santore <jsbh+@andrew.cmu.edu>\nSubject: Re: Hockey guest spots...\nOrganization: Sophomore, Mathematics, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\nLines: 28\nNNTP-Posting-Host: po4.andrew.cmu.edu\nIn-Reply-To: <1993Apr22.202856.20760@epas.toronto.edu>\n\n>Hi guys....\n>        I'm looking to answe a bit of trivia.

Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\n-- \n\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \t\t\t\tXyvision Color Systems\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\t\t101 Edgewater Drive\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\t\t\t\tWakefield MA\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\t\t018801285\n"}, {"text": "From: dhartung@chinet.chi.il.us (Dan Hartung)\nSubject: Re: Feds Caught in Another Lie\nOrganization: Chinet - Public Access UNIX\nLines: 28\n\nkdw@icd.ab.com (Kenneth D.

WHY?\n\nI believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,\nand it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part\nin the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even \nsuggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the\ncontext of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, \nas it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof\nmight be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests\nfor sufficient fire power. \n\nImportant dates: \nFeb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.\nFeb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.\t   \n\nOn Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon\nban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate\nin N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have\nan Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated\nagenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some\ngroup with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially\nat the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent \non \"Street Stories\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \"get \nready fast\", as \"they know we are coming\". I believe this attack continued, \neven tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top \ndown. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to\ncome up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.\n\n...rich \n\n\n"}, {"text": "From: pvr@wang.com ()\nSubject: Crypto File System reference?\nOrganization: Wang Labs, Lowell MA, USA\nNntp-Posting-Host: preilley.wiis.wang.com\nLines: 10\n\n   A while ago there was a reference to a paper on a crypto file\nsystem (CFS) given by someone at at AT&T (?).

The keywords `Monthly Posting'\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\ndocumentation provided there.\n\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\n\nrec.autos.tech\n\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\n\nrec.autos.sport\n\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\n\nrec.autos.driving\n\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\n\nrec.autos.vw\n\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\nto this request'.\n\nAnswering the Question:\n\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\ndefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --\nit's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly\naddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see\nyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\nself-righteous.\n\n\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\n\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\nof these topics include the following:\n\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\n\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\n    radar detectors.\n\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\n\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue\n    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)\n\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\n\n6)  `Buy American' discussions\n\n7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\n\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\n\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\n          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\n\n\n\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\n\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n"}, {"text": "From: dianem@boi.hp.com (Diane Mathews)\nSubject: Re: Janet Reno killed the Waco children\nDistribution: na\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard / Boise, Idaho\nLines: 12\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.153450.27407@ncsu.edu> dsh@eceyv.ncsu.edu (Doug Holtsinger) writes:\n>Janet Reno killed the Waco children.

The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes\nthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and\nhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.\n\nDid you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?\n\nIf you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of\nthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  \nAs you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more \nthan you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in \nthe tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is \nat the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best\nguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second\nmarker?  \n\nAnyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape\nis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The\ntape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where\nthe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the \nlight that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty\nor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have\na problem detecting the end of the tape.\n\nIf the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either\nthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open\nthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head\nassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may\nneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor\nis out. \n\nIf it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for\nrepair.\n\n\n---\nScott Hiles\nwhiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\n\nStandard disclaimer:\n  The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily \n  reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

(To\n>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\n>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\n>problems are notoriously problematic.)  \n\nOkay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\n\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \n\n\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\nhasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\nresearch then it can't be of any interest to us.\"  \n\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There've got to\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\n\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most \nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \nit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\nprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to\npractice it over again at home.\n\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \n\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \nfrom scientific acceptance.) \n\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don't have any way of \nknowing that it's effective.\"  \n\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't \nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of \nbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \ndetail as I'm capable of.)  \n\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \nfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \nattitudes about science.  \n\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \nIf so, I apologize. \n \n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\n"}, {"text": "From: paul@actrix.co.at (Paul Gillingwater)\nSubject: Re: Merlin, Mithras and Magick\nOrganization: Home Office in Vienna, Austria\nX-Newsreader: rusnews v1.01\nLines: 28\n\nkosinski@us.oracle.com (Kevin Osinski) writes:\n\n> I recall reading in Michael (?)
